Financing is often easier with new cars, and they typically come with all the latest technology and safety features. However, no matter how you look at it, buying a new car is generally not a financially sound decision for several reasons. Take a look at the reasons why buying used is a smarter choice in the long run.\n\n__1. New Cars Depreciate Immediately__\n\nIf you're trying to decide whether to buy new or used cars, remember that the moment you take your new car off the lot, it goes down in value. Some makes of cars do hold their value better than others, and new cars do last much longer today than they used to. Nevertheless, new cars can still lose as much as 30 percent of their value within the first year. \n\nAlso consider that you've most likely borrowed money to buy that new car, and you're already losing as much as 30 percent of its actual value while making payments on it, including interest. No matter how you view it, buying a new car cannot qualify as a good investment when it loses so much money so quickly.\n\n__2. Get More For Your Money__\n\nThe depreciation on a new car can actually be a boon when you're a used car shopper. Your budget for a new car might only get you the base trim of your favored model, but if you shop that model a few years back, you might be able to afford a mid-level or top trim. For example, if you buy a vehicle coming out of a two- or three-year lease, you might be able to save as much as 50 percent off the original sticker price. \n\n__3. Certified Pre-Owned Cars Provide Peace of Mind__\n\nIf you're concerned about not getting a new-vehicle warranty on something used, then it's a good idea to investigate the options available with certified pre-owned cars. Nearly every automaker offers some form of this program to make buying a used car less anxiety-inducing. The CPO system is different with each manufacturer, and it's important to remember that dealer-certified and manufacturer-certified vehicles are not the same. \n\nManufacturer certified pre-owned vehicles typically offer a much higher level of protection. The program usually includes some type of warranty based on time or mileage, plus extras like roadside assistance or a free rental when your vehicle needs to spend time in the shop.\n\nHowever, don't buy a CPO vehicle just because you think it's the only way to get a warranty on a used vehicle. Many dealerships and individual companies allow you to purchase a warranty on a used vehicle as a way to buy an extra layer of peace of mind. \n\n__4. Used Car Variety is Hard to Beat__\n\nSomewhere between 300 and 400 new car models go up for sale every year in the U.S., but the used car market holds even more variety. Carmakers discontinue trims and models on a regular basis, and your perfect car may be lurking a few years back in the trim made for only one year. For example, maybe you're looking for a small pickup. That type of vehicle is harder to find in the current market with crossovers dominating, but if you look used, then Ford Rangers, older Toyota Tacomas and Chevy Colorados and S-10s are everywhere.\n\n__5. Used Cars Have Data__\n\nAnother great thing about buying used is all the data that you can pour over concerning vehicle reliability. Carmakers redesign their models every five to seven years, and the redesign might include a new engine, transmission, electronics or suspension. The previous model's reliability might not be enough to indicate how the new model will turn out. However, with used cars, all the data on reliability and common problems is right there at your fingertips (check with Consumer Reports and J.D. Power). Not only that, but the depreciated value of used cars more easily tracked as well. You can find out exactly how much you should be paying in your area for specific makes, models and trims.\n\n__6. Cut Your Insurance Costs__\n\nWhen you're trying to decide to buy a new or used car, insurance cost is another factor to remember. Typically the more value a car has, the more the insurance company has to pay if the vehicle is damaged. A used vehicle is going to cost less to replace than a brand new vehicle. \n\nDepreciation won't mean too much to an insurance company if the new vehicle is wrecked within the same year it was bought. Naturally, the insurance company will pass this potential cost onto you, the driver. However, a model that has already depreciated and is three years old won't cost as much to replace and therefore it won't cost as much for you to insure.\n\n__7. Cut Your Registration Fees__\n\nThis doesn't apply in every state, but many states base their registration fees on the age of the car and/or the value of the car. A car that is worth less money is charged lower registration fees in states that use this system. For example, a state like Massachusetts levies an excise tax on cars that goes down as the car gets older. Once the car is five years old, the tax bottoms out.\n\n__8. Cars Last Longer__\n\nThe basic truth is that cars are lasting longer than ever. 100,000 miles is no longer the end of a car's life without Toyota or Honda in the name. Many automakers have models that can go well past that and several even offer warranties that go up to that mileage. It's always good to have your prospective used car purchase inspected by a mechanic, but 100,000 miles or more on the odometer should no longer be a major deterrent. \n\n__9. Vehicle History Reports__\n\nIf a vehicle's reliability data isn't enough to move you to the used car market, then the easy access to vehicle history reports might do the job instead. Various companies offer thorough vehicle histories to help you avoid pitfalls like salvaged titles, flood-damaged vehicles, fraud and more. The one caveat here is that vehicle issues need to be reported properly in order to reflect on a report, so it's definitely not a substitute for an inspection by a qualified mechanic.\n\n__10. The Aftermarket Community is Thriving__\n\nAnother great thing about buying a used car is the wealth of information available about them. Forums and car sites often have a thriving user base ready to volunteer information about owning certain makes and models. Anything from persistent problems to quirks, recalls and other information.\n\nBuying a used car used to be a major gamble, but with all the pro-car buyer programs and information available, buying a used car that fits your needs can be a very sound investment.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Car Buying","Used Cars"],"ctaText":"View Used Cars for Sale Near Me","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-01-11T01:43:51.212Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1mtK9EP1iEwoAkY8oskSqo/7faf2267fd33b10eabc6a29dfb9d5d55/inspecting-used-car-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6vAuUnsdPyWaMim6i8m6C4/fbb5ec10b952f0dd1212269d9d601831/used-car-inspection-checklist.jpg","slug":"used-car-inspection-checklist","title":"Used Car Inspection Checklist - What to Look For","publication_date":"2019-03-15T11:09-08:00","content_summary":"If you are in the market for a used car, having a comprehensive checklist could mean the difference between riding away in a peach and getting stuck with a lemon.","parent_page":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides","slug":"guides"},"categories":[{"name":"Buying Guides","description":"Guides that help buyers with their automotive purchase.","parentCategory":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides"}}],"category":{"name":"Buying Guides","description":"Guides that help buyers with their automotive purchase.","parentCategory":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides"}},"author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"body":"Buying a used car can be a great way to save money on interest and depreciation during your ownership of a vehicle. However, without a little research, you could end up with a purchase that you'll regret. Buying a used car can sometimes be a gamble, but you can put the odds in your favor by being thorough in your research and inspection. Here’s a checklist of what to go over to ensure peace of mind. \n\n__Start With Research__\n\nBefore you start visiting dealerships or contacting private owners, it's important to do some research (which, if you’re reading this, you’ve already started, so nice job!). If you haven’t already, figure out what type of vehicle you want, then narrow it down to a few different models. \n\nOne reason for having a specific type of vehicle in mind early is that researching items on a minivan is going to be different from researching items on an SUV. Furthermore, all vehicles tend to have specific issues isolated by model and even isolated by different years of that model. Knowing exactly what type of issues might be present in your vehicle of choice gives you an excellent starting point in inspecting it for problems.\n\nAlso, make sure you have performed a [VIN check](https://www.autolist.com/guides/autocheck-vs-carfax) and ensured there are [no open recalls](https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls).\n\n__Model Research Check List:__\n\n- Common defects and problems\n- Basic maintenance costs and intervals\n- Repair costs\n- Aging price point\n- Features and options\n\nOnce you’ve learned a little about these areas of the vehicles you’re interested in, it’s time to test drive. Here’s a quick rundown of things to look for when you go to see a vehicle. \n\n### Exterior:\n\n__Things to check:__\n- Body condition dents, rust, scratches, etc.\n- Look for uneven panels or mismatched paint\n- Doors, hood and trunk easy or difficult to open and close\n- Tire tread condition and wear\n- Same-branded tires\n- Light function and condition\n\n__Step 1: Body Condition__\nWhen you look at a vehicle that you're considering, it's important to go over it carefully before driving it.  Start with checking out the body condition. Walk around the vehicle and look for body surface defects such as scratches, dents or rust. Take note of whether there are any signs of mismatched paint as this could be a sign of a panel being replaced due to an accident.  Another clue is whether the body panels line up evenly.  Next, open and close all the doors, including the hood and trunk. Does everything close and open easily? Doors that are difficult to close or open might also be a sign of an accident. Check under the vehicle and around its wheel wells for rust; when you’re looking at the vehicle’s paint, look for signs of bubbling, which can indicate rust underneath. \n\n__Step 2: Tires__\nTake a look at the tires of your prospective car. Examine the tread by using the penny test. Place a penny with Lincoln's head side down into the tire grooves. If the head is completely visible, then the tread is badly worn and the seller should replace the tires. Look at the tread again and check to see if it has worn evenly on both sides. Uneven wear could indicate a problem with alignment. Check all the tires to see if they're the same brand; while different brands on one or more wheels isn’t necessarily a bad sign, inquire about the age of all the tires and why they’re a mismatched set. It's also a good idea to ask if the tires have been rotated regularly.\n\n__Step 3: Lights__\nNext up, check all the lights on the vehicle. Have the seller or a friend get into the car and turn on the headlights, running lights, high beams, fog lights if available and all the blinkers. Have them also depress the brake pedal to make sure those lights work. Physically examine all the light housings to look for damage such as cracks, foggy lenses or water. One of the signs of a flood-damaged vehicle is water in the light housings.\n\nOnce you’re satisfied with the outside of the vehicle, it’s time to look inside. \n\n### Interior:\n\n__Things to check:__\n- Signs of moisture or water damage\n- Unusual or offensive smells\n- Overly worn or torn upholstery\n- Seat adjustment equipment\n- Instrument cluster function and condition\n- Controls and switches working properly\n- Roof or top condition and signs of leaking\n\n__Step 1: Smell__\nThe first thing to notice is the odor in the car. The odor should be neutral or perhaps smell faintly of any air freshener item being used. If it smells like cigarette smoke or an animal, you may want to think twice as those smells are notoriously hard to remove. Another red flag is a musty or moldy smell. This tends to be a sign of either a flood-damaged vehicle or one with some type of leak. If you do smell this odor, make sure to check the interior closely for signs of mold or water damage. Ask about the vehicle’s history and what the reason is for the odor. \n\n__Step 2: Seats__\nCheck the seats next. Look at the upholstery and see if it's worn, stained or torn. If you suspect mildew from the first step, examine the seats carefully for signs of water damage. A leaking roof or window seals could also cause this, not just flood damage. Check the controls on the seats, whether manual or power, to make sure they all work properly. Specifically, check the driver's seat adjustments to ensure that you can find a comfortable position. Also make sure all of the seatbelts throughout the vehicle work — strap, buckle and retractor. \n\n__Step 3: Instruments and Controls__\nSwitch the car on into accessory mode. All the warning lights should come on for a second before flashing off again. Turn the car on and see if any of the lights stay on. Any light that stays on should be checked out. Complete your instrument check by making sure all the controls work how they should. Check the climate control and make sure the heater and AC if available work properly and switch on the audio system as well.\n\n__Step 4: Roof__\nInvestigate the roof by checking the headliner and trim. Check the seals around the windows and make sure any sun or moonroof isn't leaking. If the vehicle has a soft top, convertible or removable hard top, make sure to check that everything fits properly and isn't leaking. On older vehicles, make sure the headliner isn’t sagging or coming undone from the ceiling itself. \n\n__Check Under the Hood__\nThe next goal is to check under the hood. Even if you aren't a mechanic, there are a few things to look for. Look at all the belts and hoses to ensure that they aren't overly worn, fraying or loose from their ends. Look at the radiator and make sure it isn't stained or cracked. Check the underside of the hood for signs of fluid dripping off it; if you see this, it could be a sign of a blown gasket or hose that then leaked. \n\nCheck all the fluids in the car, including the engine oil, transmission, power steering and brake. Make sure the fluid levels are good and that there's no sign of leaking underneath the car. Oil color should be a warm brown. Dark brown or black suggests that the oil needs to be changed, which might say something about how the car is taken care of. Light brown means it has just been changed. Make sure there are no water droplets on the dipstick or gray, foamy fluid. These could be signs of a blown head gasket or cracked block. Transmission fluid should smell like oil and be pinkish. Brown fluid with a burnt odor could indicate problems.\n\n__Test Drive__\nThis is the most crucial part of your inspection. Take the car on both the highway and city streets. Vary your speed and try to climb and descend at least one hill. Make sure there are no unusual vibrations or noises and that the transmission shifts smoothly. Make sure that it accelerates smoothly and doesn't lose power on inclines. Check the brakes in both a gradual and sudden stop situation to see how they perform. Let the car idle at some point as well to make sure it idles smoothly and doesn't drop or lope. While you're doing this, you can also observe the exhaust and ensure that it's not cloudy and white, black or blue-tinged.\n\n__Final Steps__\nThe final steps to buying a used car are to have it professionally inspected by a mechanic and get a vehicle history report. Make sure the VIN matches everywhere on the vehicle and that it matches the registration. Another tip is to make sure that the registration and title match the person selling you the car or someone in the household. Also, make sure the seller has the title of the vehicle in hand; be wary of sellers who have a complicated story as to the whereabouts of the physical title. \n\n__Final Checklist:__\n- Proper fluid levels and condition\n- No signs of leaking\n- Hoses and belts not worn or cracked\n- Test drive for shaking, noises and proper operation\n- Smooth idle\n- No exhaust issues\n- Paperwork checks out\n- Mechanic inspection","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Car Buying","Inspections","How To"],"ctaText":"Browse Cars for Sale","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-04-04T23:26:57.135Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5XaV2RjamcO6Uew6wUOiOy/f6d6e30b7d7099dc06a19a1992a5fd54/carfax-vs-autocheck-image-1166c.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4ZgQ68p6SQQ8UUUSOigeeC/e761e5be0de3028bbefdba28ba3e3c6f/carfax-vs-autocheck-image-325c.jpg","slug":"autocheck-vs-carfax","title":"AutoCheck vs Carfax - Which One Should I Use?","publication_date":"2019-04-14T11:45-07:00","content_summary":"Updated 2019!

While there are many benefits to buying used, doing so also means you'll want to take a peek into the vehicle's background as part of your research before making a decision. After all, even a cheap used car is still a big purchase that's worth pursuing carefully.\n\n![AutoCheck vs Carfax](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2sA13nBcnYsf9KA3icDMLz/e11a7a6a8cff33a6d77cc55132be4c09/autocheck-vs-carfax.jpg)\n\n## The Options\n\nThere are two primary companies that provide information about used cars: AutoCheck and Carfax.\n\nBoth are subscription services and they both deliver a thorough look into the history of a vehicle's service records, potential accidents and emissions records. A vehicle history report will also show salvage titles and other red flags for used vehicles, such as branded titles (sometimes also called salvage titles). \n\nBoth services draw information from the __National Motor Vehicle Title Information System__ (NMVTIS), which is run by the federal Department of Justice. This agency collects its title information from state motor vehicle registries. It's the only publicly-available system in the U.S. that all insurance carriers, auto recyclers, junk yards and salvage yards must report to regularly.\n\nIn other words, both Carfax and Autocheck let you analyze the vehicle's past so you can make an informed purchase. They're very similar services, but there are some key differences you should understand before selecting one.\n\n## Top Things to Know\n\nWhile both Carfax and AutoCheck are useful services, they're only as good as the documentation they're provided. If a body shop makes repairs and fails to update the vehicle's history, that incident won't show up in your report. Likewise, if someone has had a fender-bender and fixes their vehicle themselves or privately without telling the insurance company, you won't see that on the report either.\n\nUnfortunately, this means that a vehicle could theoretically have prior damage without it showing up in the report. Nevertheless, it’s a good idea to obtain a vehicle history report prior to buying a used car.\n\nReports from AutoCheck and Carfax do cost money, particularly if you're buying a used vehicle privately since there won't be a dealer involved who often offers a report from one of these services as part of the sale.\n\nIf you're at the dealership and want to know the history of a given car, request the report. Dealers usually have subscriptions to AutoCheck or Carfax and will run a free report for seriously interested buyers. It __should be considered a red flag__ if any seller -- dealer or private party -- refuses to run a report or provide you with an outdated report.\n\nHere's a look at Carfax versus AutoCheck:\n\n## Carfax\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ivHdfVHCHSw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nCarfax is more well-known than Autocheck and is so named because the company was founded in 1984, before the Internet, when it faxed reports to customers. Both Carfax and Autocheck reports are available on used vehicles and light trucks manufactured in 1981 and beyond.\n\n__Unique Data__\n\nCarfax offers features that Autocheck doesn’t, such as their guaranteed buyback program and information on open recalls. With the guaranteed buyback program, if they made a mistake on your vehicle history report, they will buy the vehicle back from you. For many used car buyers, that kind of reassurance is well-worth the higher cost of admission. \n\n__A Bit More Costly__\n\nCarfax is the more expensive option: As of this writing, a single Carfax report (for a single vehicle) cost $39.99, three costs $59.99 and six is $99.99. For comparison, AutoCheck charges $24.99 for one or $49.99 for 25 reports in 21 days. \n\nWith those prices in mind, if you plan on casting a wide net and comparing many similar vehicles, Autocheck is clearly the more frugal option. However, if you just want to learn in-depth details about one specific vehicle, it may be worth spending a little extra for Carfax's extra features and data.\n\nAlthough they cost more, Carfax reports tend to be __highly detailed__ yet easier to understand, making them more user-friendly. Data such as mileage and the number of owners a vehicle has had are clearly labeled and neatly organized into sections. \n\n__Includes Service \u0026 Maintenance Records__\n\nFurthermore, Carfax is also the only report to show records such as maintenance dates, provided that the vehicle was serviced in a facility that shares this type of data, like the service department for a franchised dealership. This lets you see how well previous owners cared for the car, as well as any issues it may have had.\n\nCarfax receives data from over 100,000 sources, including every United States and Canadian provincial motor vehicle agency. Carfax also receives data from less common sources too, including auto auctions, police and fire departments, and collision repair shops. In North America alone, the Carfax database contains over 17.5 billion records.\n\nOf course, when it comes to vehicle data, quality matters too. Carfax reports provide a wide range of information, including information that you may not find on Autocheck reports.\n\n### Example Data You'll Find on Carfax\n\nHere are some examples of the type of data you'll find on a Carfax report:\n\n__Title Information__\n\nYou can discover if the car has a junk, flood, branded title or salvage title, or if it's ever been used as part of a commercial fleet. This provides insight into how the vehicle was used (and possibly abused), which helps to shed light on what you can expect from it in the future. After all, even if there's no structural damage, it's wise to learn about any wear and tear that may have taken its toll on the vehicle's many components.\n\n__Odometer Readings__\n\nCarfax also provides TIMA (Truth in Mileage Act)-certified odometer readings. This information lets you proceed with confidence, knowing that the odometer hasn't been fraudulently adjusted. \n\n__Lemons and Buybacks__\n\nIn the United States, Carfax reports also show lemon titles and manufacturer buybacks, helping you to avoid vehicles that have been problematic in the past. They also show where the vehicle was originally registered and used, giving you a better idea of the kind of conditions it has been exposed to.\n\n__Transfers of Ownership__\n\nCarfax reports also detail any transfers of ownership. After all, if the vehicle has had many owners, there's probably a reason. If the vehicle has a lien against it, your Carfax report will acknowledge it so you don't accidentally purchase property that technically doesn't belong to the seller due to outstanding debt. Carfax also lets you know if the vehicle is or has been stolen.\n\n__Inspections and Repairs__\n\nYou can also find information on when and where a car was inspected, including whether it passed or failed safety and emissions inspections. You can also learn about any maintenance records, repairs or other service history. If the vehicle has a consistent history of needing repairs, it may be prudent to look elsewhere. Carfax also lets you know if a vehicle has been recalled so you can make sure that any repairs or exchanges have already been completed.\n\n__Accidents__\n\nAdditionally, Carfax is guaranteed to have information about severe accidents, and Carfax offers the largest publicly accessible database of smaller accident reports that may not be reported elsewhere. That said, smaller accidents aren't guaranteed to show up on Carfax reports. Some accidents simply aren't reported, and others may be reported to agencies that don't provide Carfax with data.\n\n## AutoCheck\n\nAutoCheck is owned by Experian and it has relationships with industry leaders including CarMax (different than Carfax), eBay Motors, Edmunds.com, NADAguides.com, and Kelley Blue Book. This company __assigns each vehicle a numerical score__ (similar to a credit score for cars) within a range for similar examples of the same vehicle, age and mileage.\n\n__AutoCheck Score__\n\nThe score is intended to demonstrate how well the vehicle stacks up against other available cars in its class. This allows you to quickly weed out any vehicles with issues, which can be as benign as high mileage and repossessions or as serious as damage from one or more reported accidents. It will also let you know whether the car was ever used by police or taxi services.\n\nThese scores pay close attention to collision data, giving potential buyers a thorough look at what's happened (if anything) in the vehicle's past that might warrant concern.\n\nUnfortunately, the scale can be a little confusing, and how AutoCheck determines those numbers isn't particularly obvious. Those who prefer a highly detailed report may want to spend a little extra on Carfax reports. However, those who aren't as technically savvy may find that a simple numerical score streamlines the process and makes the information more easily digestible. It's largely a matter of preference.\n\n__Unique to AutoCheck: Auction Data__\n\nOne of AutoCheck's key advantages over Carfax is that it has exclusive access to auction data from the two largest United States auctions, giving prospective buyers a more comprehensive look at a vehicle's history (this is why their reports have a better reputation with used car dealers).\n\nFurthermore, AutoCheck lets their subscribers run up to 300 reports using VIN numbers (Vehicle Identification Number) from a desktop or tablet computer – or even a smartphone. As of this writing, Carfax did not offer any similar service.\n\nAutocheck provides much of the same information as Carfax, however __its database is not as large__. That said, some data available from Autocheck may not be available on Carfax too, so you may want to consider getting reports from both platforms just to be thorough.\n\n### Example Data You'll Find on AutoCheck:\n\nAutocheck provides registration and title data from all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia. The platform also delivers collision records from police reports and other sources, as well as event data from insurance companies and salvage yards.\n\n__Frequent Problem Area Checks__\n\nAutocheck checks for records of the vehicle being abandoned, damaged, junked or scrapped. Any major incidents reported to relevant databases are acknowledged. The platform also reports any documented fire, hail or water damage, as well as any frame or structural damage or odometer damage.\n\nThe platform also delivers any relevant records pertaining to the vehicle's relation with the grey market, recycling facilities or insurance loss or probable total loss. Autocheck delivers records of manufacturer buybacks or lemons, as well as reports on whether the vehicle is rebuilt or rebuildable. \n\n__NHTSA Data__\n\nAutocheck also provides any relevant NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) records that may be associated with the car, like branded title data. That way you can buy with confidence, knowing that your vehicle has passed safety standards.\n\n__Lower Cost__\n\nAs we mentioned, AutoCheck is cheaper than Carfax; a current single report is $24.99, 25 reports over 21 days is $49.99 and the 300-limit plan is $99.99. That's why many dealers use Autocheck. It's undoubtedly the more frugal option, however, the reports aren't as robust.\n\n## Which to Choose\n\nFirst of all, you may not need to decide. If you're buying through a dealer, broker or online service, it's likely that they will offer a report from one or both of these services. For example, Autolist often lists cars that come with free Carfax reports included. \n\nWhile Carfax reports are more expensive, we believe that potential buyers have the right to as much information as possible. Carfax reports simply offer more information, and when it comes to buying a used car, knowledge is power.\n\nBoth data sources do offer similar benefits, however. So, if you simply want to make sure that the car isn't stolen, for example, you may find choosing the cheaper option: Autocheck.\n\n__What Are Your Goals?__\n\nTo determine the best course of action, start by reviewing your goals. Do you want a highly detailed overview of the vehicle, or do you simply want to check to make sure the sale is legitimate?\n\nAre you spending a significant amount of money on a long-term daily driver, or are you simply getting the cheapest possible beater to get you from point A to B? Are you seeking a particular vehicle, or are you willing to take whatever fits your budget?\n\nThose who are making a serious investment would be wise to use Carfax or both platforms. The extra cost of Carfax gives you priceless peace of mind, knowing that you've used the most comprehensive option. Even if you're not actively seeking specific information, you may be surprised when new details show up that you didn't expect.\n\nAt the same time, Autocheck is still a very handy tool that may accomplish everything you need and more -- especially if you want a numerical Autocheck score that sums up the information for you. Just make sure that the information you're seeking is, in fact, covered by Autocheck's database.\n\nFinally, if you're browsing many different cars, it may make more sense to use Autocheck's 25 or 300-limit plan. That way you have the freedom to generate reports on any vehicle that sparks your interest, without having to dwell on the cost. After all, if you're spending some time finding that perfect ride, the cost of paying for each individual report adds up fast.\n\n## Both Reports Aren't Perfect\n\nWhile there's no denying that both Carfax and Autocheck reports are extremely useful, it's important to remember that both reports are limited to their databases, meaning that even the most detailed reports could be missing certain information.\n\nCarfax receives data from more organizations, so if there's an undisclosed issue with the vehicle, you're more likely to find it there. Additionally, Carfax does state that if there's a mistake on your vehicle history report, they will buy the vehicle back from you.\n\nHowever, even using both Carfax and Autocheck doesn't guarantee that you're going to discover every existing or potential issue. Some issues may have never been reported, or Carfax or Autocheck may not have access to certain information.\n\nThere's always going to be a certain amount of risk involved in buying used vehicles. The trick is to use tools like these to mitigate the risk. The odds are in your favor. After all, between both platforms, you have access to a tremendous amount of information. Just try not to depend on them as your only source of information.\n\nWhen it comes to learning about a car's history, it's wise to shop at reputable car lots and online platforms. You may be able to get a great deal buying through an independent seller, but there's more risk involved too.\n\nIf you do decide to buy from an independent dealer, communication is key. Spend some time researching the vehicle. Learn about common issues related to that specific model. Once you're armed with knowledge, you can ask the seller questions.\n\nOf course, there's no guarantee that a seller is going to be honest about the vehicle's history. At the same time, simply showing that you're an informed shopper is often enough to encourage sellers to be more transparent.\n\n## Start with Free Reports\n\nIn many cases you'll get one or both reports for free.  For example, here at Autolist, our platform gives you access to thousands of new and used car listings, as well as detailed information such as how long the car has been for sale and how its price compares to similar cars. That way you can make an informed decision on how to proceed.  In many cases dealers listing their vehicles on [Autolist](https://www.autolist.com) will provide a free Carfax report. \n\n__Free Carfax report example on Autolist:__\n\n![autolist-carfax-image](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1n6a7BUytGeuciu4iKqEm/1f49c7ee091ceb6d282fafd9a378feb3/autolist-carfax-image.jpg)\n\nIf you're shopping elsewhere and the seller doesn't offer a report and you're serious about buying a specific vehicle from them -- ask them to provide you one for free. Many sellers will provide one gladly; just make sure that you're genuinely interested in the vehicle, as the seller may have to pay for the report out of pocket.\n\nIf you're buying privately or the seller declines to make a report available, it's up to you if you want to spend the money. However, if the seller isn't willing to pay for the report, you may want to look elsewhere. \n\nAfter all, while there's nothing wrong with pinching pennies, a good seller recognizes a buyer's need for details. If they're not providing as many details as possible, there might be a reason. \n\nIf your dealer refuses to work with you to help you make an informed purchase, you may want to find a seller with a better reputation and a more buyer-friendly approach (especially if you're not well-versed int he automotive industry.\n\n## Get Both\n\nAt the end of the day, it never hurts to have as much information as possible. After all, even a relatively cheap used car is still a major purchase.\n\nWhen you look at the big picture, paying a little bit of extra money for these reports isn't going to make a big difference in your overall spending, and the information gained can go a long way in protecting your investment as a car buyer.\n\nWhen it comes down to Carfax vs. Autocheck, both companies enjoy excellent reputations in the industry and can provide you with important information. It's up to you to determine if an Autocheck report is enough to meet your needs, or if you prefer a more robust detailing of the vehicle in question.\n\nAutoCheck's 25 reports in 21 days plan can be an economical way to check the history of a variety of vehicles you're interested in. Autocheck vehicle history reports may not be as detailed, but if you only need basic information or a simple rating, often they're just fine.\n\nCarFax, meanwhile, gives you a great look at the service history of a vehicle so you have a keen sense of what work a car has had done and what work you might need to be prepared for. If you're buying a more expensive vehicle, or if you're just highly detail-oriented, a Carfax report may be ideal for you.\n\n### A Small Investment\n\nFor around $65, you're buying comprehensive peace of mind, which is a bargain for any vehicle. Research the vehicle independently beforehand, and only buy reports for cars that you're genuinely considering purchasing.

Each has its upsides and downsides and factors like how much you use your car and what for, as well as how long you plan to keep your vehicle will help determine whether you are better off going with a lease or just buying. \n\nLeasing allows you to enjoy the use of a car without owning it. In this case, you only pay for the depreciation that occurs over the term of the lease, plus fees and interest. However, there are some reasons why it may make more sense for you to own your vehicle outright by buying it.\n\n### Financial Considerations\n\n__Down Payment__\nWhether you lease or buy, the down payment may be as low as zero, but the lower your down payment is, the higher your monthly payments will be. Also, most leases with zero down payment are only offered to those who have excellent credit.\n\n__Interest__\nLease: You only pay interest on the difference between the capitalized cost (the actual price of the vehicle you've negotiated plus any fees and taxes on the vehicle) and the vehicle’s residual value (what it's expected to be worth at the end of the lease).\n\nBuy: You pay interest on the entire amount of money you borrow, which includes the cost of the car and sometimes add-ons like maintenance plans or warranties.\n\n__Mileage__\nLease: Leases have strict mileage limits, which can get expensive. Many leases charge you per mile for every mile you go over the limit; excess mileage charges can be anywhere from 15 to 30 cents or more per mile. While the automakers or dealers dictate the number of miles you can drive per year, they don’t check annually to ensure that you’re under the limit -- so it's up to you to keep track. \n\nThe total allowed mileage is calculated by taking the number of years and multiplying it by the number of annual miles allowed. Since this total number of miles is priced into the lease, if you are way *under* the mileage limit when you return the vehicle, you’ve essentially paid for miles you didn’t use. \n\nBuy: When you own a car, you have no mileage limitations, but if you drive a lot, you may exhaust the warranty early. Nevertheless, if you drive a lot, buying a car often makes better financial sense than leasing. \n\n__Monthly Payments__\nBecause you’re paying for the depreciation that occurs during the term of a lease, monthly payments are usually lower with a lease than they are when you buy and used a financed loan. \n\nThis often means that if you lease, you can get a nicer, larger or newer vehicle -- or one with a few extra options on it -- than you would have been able to afford if you were buying. It also means you can save more money by leasing the same vehicle you were considering buying. \n\n__Ownership__\nLease: You are not the owner of your car, you just pay for the right to use it, like when you rent an apartment. The vehicle is owned by the company that holds the title, often the automaker itself. If the vehicle is totaled or stolen, the leasing company is paid off, but then you’ll need to go lease or finance another car.\n\nHowever, most leases do offer you the option to buy the vehicle for a set price at the end of the lease term. \n\nBuy: If you purchase a car for cash, you own it outright, and therefore can do with it as you please. If you’ve taken out a loan, your vehicle’s title will be held by the lender until it is paid off, at which time you own it free and clear. \n\n__Sales Tax__\nLease: In some cases, you only pay tax on the amount you put down and on your monthly payments. In others, you pay sales tax on the entire value of the car just as you would if you were buying it. This usually depends on the state where you buy the vehicle, so check with your dealer. \n\nBuy: Purchasers pay tax on the entire cost of the vehicle minus the value of any trade-in, in most states. \n\n__Trading In__\nWhen your lease is up, you simply return the car to the dealership and pay any final fees, including any charges for excess mileage or wear and tear. You can then lease or purchase another car, with little to no hassle.  As we mentioned, most leases do offer you the option to buy that car at that time if you've become attached to it or your finances are better suited to owning.\n\nIf you own your car, you have to sell it yourself or get a fair trade-in price for it, which may take much longer and involve more work on your part.\n\n__Warranty Coverage and Maintenance__\nLease: Unless you put a lot of miles on it or lease a used vehicle, the manufacturer's warranty covers it for the entire term of the lease, since that term is just a few years. What's more, some leases even include maintenance such as oil changes and air filters – even tires – as part of the agreement. This gives you a more predictable cost of ownership, reducing unexpected out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nBuy: New-car bumper-to-bumper and powertrain warranties vary in length so depending on how long yours is and how long you plan on owning the car, it's possible your warranty will expire before you sell your car.\n\n### Other Considerations\n\n__Changing Your Mind__\nWhen you sign a lease, you’re usually locked into that contract for the length of the lease. When you buy your car, you can keep it for as long as you like. If you decide that it’s just not really what you want – for whatever reason – you can sell it. You can also refinance a loan, but renegotiating a lease is more difficult.     \n\n__Customization__\nNo matter how much you might think changes to it enhance the vehicle’s value, your lease papers state that the car must be returned just as it was when delivered to you, minus normal wear and tear. However, when you own it, you can alter the car as much as you'd like. Your changes may even add value to the vehicle or at least allow you to break even when you eventually sell it.\n\n__Usage Restrictions__\nLease agreements can have strict limitations regarding where you drive your car and what you can use it for -- particularly commercial use. Because of this, if you’re planning to use your vehicle for anything other than what's considered normal use, be sure to find out beforehand whether it's is allowed. \n\nThis is not a concern when you own the car.\n\n### Summary\n\nTo recap, leasing is a great option because it gives you flexibility. This matters if you like to change cars every couple of years, if you would like a nicer car than buying will allow given your financial state or if your needs for a vehicle will change in the near future (like having kids or moving to an area where you'll need all-wheel-drive). \n\nOwning is ideal if you want to keep your vehicle for an extended period of time, if you plan on putting a lot of miles on your vehicle, use it for something that might be prohibited within the terms of a lease contract, such as rideshare driving, or simply like the idea of building up equity in your vehicle that you can then capitalize on later.

However, some of the Sunshine State's car insurance requirements differ from elsewhere in the U.S. Here's a breakdown of the minimum coverage you need to stay on the right side of Florida law.\n\n### How Do Florida Car Insurance Laws Differ from Other Car Insurance Laws?\n\nFlorida insurance laws are unusual in that the state doesn't legally require drivers to have bodily injury liability coverage. That is, you're not required to insure yourself against any injuries that people receive if you cause an accident. However, Florida — along with 11 other states, such as Massachusetts and Pennsylvania — is a no-fault state. That means everyone in an accident must file a claim with their insurance company, even if they're not at fault. No-fault law in the state of Florida mandates that drivers get personal injury protection insurance to cover them in case they or their passengers are hurt in an accident that's not their fault. PIP insurance sidesteps the need for accident victims to file a claim with the perpetrator's insurance. As of 2019, Florida's PIP coverage pays for four-fifths of medical bills and three-fifths of lost wages, once the insured motorist pays a deductible. Also, PIP motorist coverage pays Florida drivers $5,000 in death benefits.\n\n### What's Florida's Financial Responsibility Law?\n\nFlorida's Financial Responsibility Law states that drivers must provide financial coverage of at least $20,000 per accident and $10,000 per person if they cause a car accident. Uninsured motorists must still post a bond to meet this coverage. This law also requires that drivers cover up to $10,000 for potential property damage. The combined single limit under this law — that is, the minimum coverage a driver in Florida must have — is $30,000. Fortunately, most car insurance companies cover this minimum amount, and some offer plans that cover much more. In addition to requiring liability coverage for accidents that cause injuries, this law requires coverage for DUI citations, suspensions due to drivers license demerits and revocations due to severe traffic offenses.\n\n### How Does Personal Injury Protection Insurance Work in Florida?\n\nPIP Insurance covers your medical expenses due to an accident, regardless of who's at fault. If you have this insurance, your family members are also covered, along with any passengers who don't have personal injury protection, provided they don't own a registered vehicle. If your passengers have PIP Insurance and suffer injuries, their insurance covers their medical payments. Also, licensed drivers who drive your vehicle with your consent are covered by your PIP Insurance. PIP covers other circumstances in Florida as well, such as if your child is hurt while riding a school bus or if you're injured while biking or crossing the street. \n\nFlorida requires anyone who owns a vehicle with four or more wheels to get at least $10,000 of PIP coverage. The main benefit of no-fault insurance and personal injury protection is that monthly premiums are low due to quick payouts and fewer lawsuits. The main drawback is that reckless drivers aren't as likely to lose significant assets in an accident, resulting in less of an incentive to drive well. Fraud also occurs from PIP insurance, as clinics sometimes play up injuries to receive the full $10,000 payout. Florida drivers can also get extended personal injury protection, which covers all medical expenses and four-fifths of lost wages. \n\n### What Are Florida's Laws on Bodily Injury Liability Insurance?\n\nBodily injury liability insurance, which covers injury or death to others if you crash a vehicle, isn't required in Florida. However, it's good optional coverage to have, and many insurance companies package it with other types of coverage. Bodily injury liability insurance doesn't just cover the injuries you cause. It covers the injuries all your family members cause, even if they're not driving your vehicle. Plus, this insurance provides legal representation if you're ever sued by someone you injured, such as if you cause them permanent damage or they incur bills beyond their PIP coverage. Bodily injury liability can also protect personal assets from being seized in such a lawsuit. Although this insurance isn't required for most people, drivers who've received a DUI may be compelled to get it.\n\n### What Are Florida's Laws on Property Damage Liability Insurance?\n\nAll drivers in Florida must have property damage liability insurance. This insurance covers any property you or your family members damage in a crash, be it a fence, bicycle, car or something else. $10,000 of property damage liability insurance coverage is the minimum requirement in Florida. This insurance usually includes legal representation if you're sued for damaging property. Keep in mind that the average property damage claim is only about $3,231, as of 2019, so you probably don't need more than the minimum requirement for this insurance.\n\n### Other Considerations\n\nThere are a few other things you should know about Florida car insurance laws. For example, neither comprehensive nor collision car insurance coverage is required in Florida. Collision coverage pays for any repairs you need if your vehicle is damaged in an accident, while comprehensive coverage pays for damage from other causes, such as theft, hail or flooding. Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage is also optional. This insurance covers any expenses that exceed the PIP minimum. \n\nAnother consideration to keep in mind if you live in Florida is that you can receive a fine of $150 to $500 for driving without proof of insurance — namely, your Florida auto insurance ID card. Your driver's license can also get suspended for three years as punishment. Also, Florida law states that you're liable for any injuries and property damage you cause if you crash without insurance. You must pay all damages you owe before your driving privileges are reinstated. The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation regulates how high a premium you must pay for insurance, but insurers decide on the premium based on factors such as your age, marital status and credit score.\n\nOver 14 million drivers use Florida's roads every year, and they cause thousands of accidents, so it's a good idea to pay attention to Florida's car insurance laws. Remember that the minimum car insurance you need must be issued through a licensed insurance agent in Florida. If you're moving to Florida from another state, you need to transfer your coverage to Florida when registering there.\n\n### Popular Searches in Florida\n\n - [Tampa Florida Used Cars](https://www.autolist.com/tampa-fl)\n - [Miami Florida Used Cars](https://www.autolist.com/miami-fl)\n - [Orlando Florida Used Cars](https://www.autolist.com/orlando-fl)\n - [Jacksonville Florida Used Cars](https://www.autolist.com/jacksonville-fl)\n - [Pensacola Florida Used Cars](https://www.autolist.com/pensacola-fl)\n - [Tallahassee, Florida Used Cars](https://www.autolist.com/tallahassee-fl)\n - [Gainesville, Florida Used Cars](https://www.autolist.com/gainsville-fl)","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Florida","Insurance"],"ctaText":"Browse All Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-05-29T00:02:50.834Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6DBTcDCix35a7XtdpJr8bW/c585f1c55828c5a7279637b0cb04d2d9/florida-car-title-transfer-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/66nG9ZD2PPuqdGVfrGIjxo/9c242441b3406248ddbaf76921076b3c/florida-car-title-transfer-325-image.jpg","slug":"florida-car-title-transfer","title":"Florida Car Title Transfer - How To","publication_date":"2019-05-24T14:26-08:00","content_summary":"Find out when and how to make a Florida car title transfer.

If you want to buy, sell, or give away your prized ride, you must complete a Florida car title transfer. Knowing how to comply with the rules enables a smooth transition to the new owner.  \n\n### When is a Florida Car Title Transfer Required?\n\nSeveral situations require a transfer of title under Florida law. When you buy a motor vehicle or mobile home from a dealer, the dealer handles the paperwork to deliver the title to you, but when you buy it from a private seller, you handle the car title transfer. If you give, donate or inherit a vehicle, it requires the transfer of the vehicle title to the new owner. If you are a lienholder, you must complete the car title transfer process after releasing the lien. A name change triggers a transfer of title because you need a title certificate in your new name. \n\n### Agencies Authorized to Transfer Florida Titles\n\nIn the state of Florida, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHSMV) in Tallahassee is responsible for issuing title certificates. County tax collector offices act as DHSMV agents to provide the services you need for transfer of titles. For example, for an additional $10 fee, the Alachua County Tax Collector issues a certificate of title when the transaction occurs, or you can have the DHSMV return the paper title to your address within four weeks. Under Florida law, you can hold an electronic title and request a paper title if you need it.\n\n### Benefits of Florida's Electronic Lien and Title (ELT) Program\n\nConsider asking for an electronic title instead of a paper title for your next Florida car title transfer. Florida's Electronic Lien and Title (ELT) program offers several benefits. Choosing an electronic title for your motor vehicle lowers costs and reduces risk of title loss, theft, and fraud. The ELT program enables state agencies to provide better customer service and allows faster notification of lien satisfactions.  If you decide to trade in your motor vehicle to a Florida motor vehicle dealer, the title stays in its electronic form and the dealer takes care of the paperwork.\n\nAt the time you transfer your motor vehicle or mobile home, ask to place the title in electronic status. Once you have an electronic title and request a paper title, it's converted to paper for a $2.50 service fee and mailed to you. To get a printed title, go to www.GoRenew.com. Some tax collector's offices provide Fast Title for $10. With Fast Title, the office prints your electronic title immediately while you wait. \n\n### How to Transfer an Electronic Title\n\nWhen you sell a motor vehicle for which you hold an electronic title, you can transfer the title electronically if the buyer agrees. You and the buyer complete and sign a secure reassignment document at the Tax Collector's office. The document states the odometer reading. If the buyer does not agree to an electronic transfer, print a paper title to transfer ownership. \n\n### Paper Car Title Transfer for Private Buyers\n\nWhen buying a motor vehicle from a private seller with a paper title, you need several items to complete the car title transfer. You should have a bill of sale from the seller as proof of ownership. The seller must complete the transfer section of the paper title and give it to you. If you see any liens on the title, ask for a copy of the lien satisfactions. You want proof of satisfaction, so you won't be on the hook for paying the lienholder. Get an Application for Certificate of Title With/Without Registration (Form HSMV 82040) and fill it out in your name. Fill out the Florida Insurance Affidavit (Form HSMV 83330) and have proof of Florida insurance, such as your auto policy or insurance card.\n\nAs of 2019, the title transfer fees in Florida are $75.25 for an electronic title or a $2.50 additional fee for a paper title. If you place liens on the vehicle, they cost $2 each. License plate and vehicle registration fees depend on the vehicle's weight. An initial $225 fee for motor vehicle registration applies to private cars, motorhomes and trucks weighing less than 5,000 pounds. Your vehicle may qualify for certain exemptions.\n\nTo ensure a smooth transaction, ask the seller to go with you to the local tax collector's office to complete the vehicle title transfer. If you are not in Florida, mail your forms and fees to your county tax collector.\n\n### Transfer of Title by Private Sellers\n\nIf you are selling your vehicle, give your buyer an original bill of sale that includes the vehicle identification number (VIN), vehicle description, date of sale and purchase price. It's wise to have it notarized for extra security and to keep a copy. Go with the buyer to the county tax collector office if you can to help ensure a successful transfer. Whether you go or not, submit a Notice of Sale or Bill of Sale for a Motor Vehicle, Mobile Home, Off-Highway Vehicle or Vessel (Form HSMV 82050) to the Florida DMV. This document lets the state know the vehicle is not in your name. While the DMV is processing the state title transfer, this notice protects you in case the new owner violates any Florida laws.\n\n### How New Florida Residents Transfer Title\n\nAre you a new Florida resident, or are you planning a move to the state? If so, you must obtain a new vehicle title, initial registration, and a Florida license plate. Complete the application for title, which is Form HSMV 82040. You need the Florida Insurance Affidavit, Form HSMV 83330, with proof of Florida insurance. Also, submit a VIN verification, which you can complete at the local Florida Department of Highway Safety office. As an alternative, submit Form HSMV 82042, Vehicle Identification Number and odometer verification.\n\nYour Florida title transfer fees are $77.25 for an out-of-state title transfer fee for an electronic title, $2 to record a lien, and $225 for a new-to-Florida vehicle fee, as of 2019. For a paper title, the charge is $2.50 more. Registration and license plate fees depend on your vehicle's weight and the type of plate you choose. Deliver your documents and fees in person or by mail to your county tax collector's office. If you request a paper title, expect to receive it within five business days after submitting your title application. \n\nThe process for completing a Florida car title transfer is fast and efficient when you understand it. Make a checklist of what you need and complete the title application and forms carefully before submitting them. Ask questions, follow the rules and get on the road legally.\n\n### Popular Searches in Florida\n\n - [Tampa Florida Used Cars](https://www.autolist.com/tampa-fl)\n - [Miami Florida Used Cars](https://www.autolist.com/miami-fl)\n - [Orlando Florida Used Cars](https://www.autolist.com/orlando-fl)\n - [Jacksonville Florida Used Cars](https://www.autolist.com/jacksonville-fl)\n - [Pensacola Florida Used Cars](https://www.autolist.com/pensacola-fl)\n - [Tallahassee, Florida Used Cars](https://www.autolist.com/tallahassee-fl)\n - [Gainesville, Florida Used Cars](https://www.autolist.com/gainsville-fl)\n","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Florida","Licensing"],"ctaText":"Browse All Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-05-28T23:54:55.389Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5TWf04cqVp8XpBtY8PR0QC/45f3907cd9241dd4d9607808d4f25143/clean-title-used-cars-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3nS2Qd6ptgx6Sb2qrpVjUX/7cb5fcde30c032d728429e818bae5bcf/clean-title-used-cars-325-image.jpg","slug":"clean-title-used-car","title":"What is a Clean Title with Used Cars?","publication_date":"2019-05-23T09:00-08:00","content_summary":"What is a title and what's on it?

When you buy, sell or otherwise transfer ownership of a vehicle, the title comes into play. Ideally, you want to deal with a clean title when purchasing a used car. A clean title means that you are not dealing with a salvage vehicle. Titles may have other brands aside from salvage title as well. Read on to find out more about car titles, what's on them and what certain designations mean.\n\n__What is A Car Title?__\n\nThe certificate of title is a document that states the legal owner of a particular vehicle. It is issued by an individual state's Department of Motor Vehicles. When you directly transfer ownership of a car, you either receive a certificate of title, or you hand one over. However, if you finance the vehicle, the bank owns the car title until you pay it off. Once it's paid off, you can expect a transfer of ownership to your name and then you will hold the car title.\n\n__What Is A Clean Title?__\n\nA clean title means that the car title has not been branded. In the section for brands on the title, it will be empty. That doesn't necessarily mean the car is free of problems, only that it has never been declared a total loss by an insurance company or found to be flood or fire damaged.\n\n__Car Title Information__\n\nCar titles contain a variety of information about the vehicle. Precisely what a title might have tends to vary by state, but the following are some examples of what you might find.\n\n__VIN ( Vehicle Identification Number) __\n\nThis is a unique number used to identify a specific vehicle. Every car has a unique VIN. The number you see on the title should also be the number imprinted on the vehicle. When buying a used car, it's a good idea to check that these numbers match. Numbers that don't match could be an indication that the vehicle is stolen or has been tampered with. Locate the VIN on a car by looking at the base of the driver's side door pillar or on the lower corner of the driver's side dash where it meets the windshield.\n\n__Year, Make, Model, Style, Series/Body__\n\nThe model year, automaker and specific model should also be on the title. This information won't necessarily be listed in obvious terms like \"1992 Toyota Celica,\" but instead, it will likely use codes to represent what the car is. The vehicle as mentioned earlier on a Washington State certificate of title lists the model as CG, the style as CP (coupe) and the series/body as CELCP.\n\n__License Number and Date Issued__\n\nThe car title may display the license number of the vehicle and the date the title was issued, which is typically the date of transfer of ownership, i.e. when the car was sold.\n\n__Mileage__\n\nThe car title may show the mileage of the vehicle, but it also might not. In some states, the mileage section might read as a series of zeros with an E under odometer status. This means that the vehicle is exempt from odometer disclosure, which is merely a result of its age.\n\n__Owner and Lienholder__\n\nCar titles exist to establish the owner of a used car. The title should list the current owner and their address. If the vehicle has been financed, it will have the lienholder on it. Once the car has been paid off, it's known as a clear title.\n\n__Other Car Title Information__\n\nOther possible items you may see on a car title include the scale weight, use class (i.e., a passenger vehicle), fuel type, vehicle color and then brands. A clean title will have nothing under this latter area.\n\n__Title Transfer__\n\nOn the back of a car title is a place to transfer the title. That allows the buyer and the seller to fill out all the required information to transfer ownership. The buyer then takes the title to the DMV and applies for a new title in their name.\n\n### Title Brands and What They Mean\n\nA branded title is a title where the brand area is filled out to indicate its status. Some brand examples include salvage, rebuilt, irreparable, and lemon or buyback.  Title brands cannot be removed except for salvage, which can be replaced with a rebuilt title by taking the required steps.\n\n__Salvage Title__\n\nA salvage title will be indicated under the brand section. This means that the vehicle was seriously damaged in some way and the insurance company called it a total loss. However, a total loss doesn't mean irreparable, and the vehicle may be rebuilt by going through the correct avenues. Nevertheless, while salvage remains on the title, the vehicle can't be insured or driven.\n\n__Rebuilt Title__\n\nA rebuilt title means that a salvage title vehicle was repaired correctly and then passed a safety inspection issued by the state. At that point, a new title is issued, now containing the brand of rebuilt. \n\n__Flood/Irreparable Title__\n\nIt varies on how this type of title is listed. It might be junk, fire or flood damaged. Either way, it means that the vehicle cannot be repaired and can only be used for parts or as scrap. If the title is a flood title, that means that the car sat in deep water that filled its engine compartment. In some states, these vehicles are cleaned up and then sent out of state to be sold. Getting a vehicle history report to see where it's been is one step to avoid buying a flood titled car.\n\n__Lemon Title__\n\nAlso known as a buyback title, this means that the vehicle had a persistent defect that could not be repaired despite several attempts. Most states require that the title disclose this information. In some states that means a brand that indicates lemon or buyback status.\n\n__What Happens To A Lost Title?__\n\nIf you lose your car title or it's destroyed, then you'll need to get a new one if you want to sell your vehicle or prove ownership. Getting a new title varies by state, but you'll typically have to deal with the DMV and pay a fee.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Titles"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-05-24T23:48:18.230Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5mRjCayJowkydNXWsKosKw/3cefa4813ecb3a521e8e42ff87c9d60f/get-your-title-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6hsPSmULpGXT9E6B75lFjx/8b4efdc9dea903722294cf9f40be02d7/get-your-title-325-image.jpg","slug":"get-your-title","title":"How to Get Your Title After Paying Off Car Loan","publication_date":"2019-05-22T09:45-08:00","content_summary":"Learn how to get title after paying off car loans and have peace of mind that your car belongs to you.

The process varies from state to state, but the result is the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) issues a new certificate of title. Knowing how to remove liens and how to get the title after paying off car loans lets you establish legal ownership of your motor vehicles. \n\n### What is a Lien?\n\nA lien is a method of protecting the right of a property owner, seller, or lending institution to take legal action if a buyer or borrower doesn't make payments on a purchase or loan. If you buy a new car and take out an auto loan, your seller or lender places a lien on your car title and becomes a lienholder. Vehicle titles contain the names and addresses of lienholders, which can be private individuals or financial institutions including credit unions. \n\nYour lienholder has the right to repossess the motor vehicle if you stop making your auto loan payments. Once you make your final payment, you have a right to obtain a lien release from the lienholder. When you get a lien released, you can receive a clear title from the DMV.     \n\n### Ways of Obtaining a Lien Release\n\nStates use different processes for obtaining lien releases, so check with your lending institution and DMV for your state's requirements. Nevada, California, Pennsylvania, New York, and Ohio are some of the states in which lien release procedures depend on whether a lender uses the Electronic Lien and Title (ELT) system or a traditional paper title. Lenders that participate in the ELT program have electronic titles and records. With many ELTs, a lien release triggers an automatic process for you to get the title after paying off the car loan.\n\nIn Nevada, lenders using ELT notify the DMV when you make the last payment, so make sure your lender has your current address. Nevada's DMV prints and mails you a new paper title without a fee. You don't have to do anything except wait for about eight weeks to receive your new title.\n\nCalifornia has a similar ELT process. Before making the last payment on your car loan, check the accuracy of your registration, mailing address, and your lender's information. After you make your final auto loan payment, the lender sends an electronic release to California's DMV. Once the DMV receives the electronic release, it issues a new certificate of title and registration card showing you're the sole owner.  \n\nELT programs help states update vehicle information faster and maintain lien records more efficiently. States save on mailing and printing costs as well. Under Pennsylvania's ELT Program, the state only prints paper titles when a lienholder releases a lien or when someone needs a paper title to assign or transfer vehicle ownership.\n\n### How to Get Title After Paying Off Car Loans in Ohio\n\nIn Ohio, if you want to sell your car and there's an ELT, first pay off the remaining amount of the car loan. The lienholder releases the lien electronically, and you pick up the title from the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) the next business day.\n\n### Paper Title Lien Releases in California\n\nA lienholder using a paper title in California must sign on line 2 of the certificate of title for the lien release. Once you get the signed certificate of title, check your address. If you changed your address and didn't update it with the DMV, draw a line through your old address on the title. Write your new address next to it. Send the signed certificate of title and a transfer fee to the DMV. The DMV removes the lienholder's name and issues a new certificate of title and registration card showing you as the sole owner.\n\n### Lien Releases for Paper Titles in New York\n\nOnce you make your last payment and want a lien released on a New York car title, contact your lienholder and obtain a notice for the New York State DMV. The notice shows you don't owe anything on your car loan. Lienholders with paper titles have two options for giving you this notice. One is that the lienholder or lender gives you Form MV-901, a Notice of Recorded Lien. \n\nA lienholder's other option is sending an official lienholder letter to the New York State DMV telling the agency you made your final car payment. New York's DMV requires that the lienholder write the letter on the lienholder's official letterhead, The letter must contain all the information about the vehicle, and an official of the lienholder company or lending institution must sign it. If the official signing the message isn't a loan officer, a notary must witness and notarize the signature.\n\n### How to Get Title After Paying Off Car Loans\n\nAs with lien releases, follow your state's Department of Motor Vehicles procedure to get the title after paying off a car loan. Procedures might differ depending on whether there's an electronic lien or a traditional lien on a paper certificate of title. Expect to pay a fee and wait several business days before the DMV sends you a new title.    \n\n### Clearing Paper Title Liens and Getting Title in Nevada\n\nIn Nevada, lenders with paper titles don't tell the DMV if you pay off your auto loans. When you pay off a motor vehicle car loan in Nevada, and there's a paper title, your lienholder must sign the vehicle title in the right place and send or give it to you. Take it to a Full-Service DMV office or mail it to the DMV. If the vehicle is registered in Nevada, the agency removes the lienholder and sends you a clear title. \n\nNevada's DMV continues to list the lienholder in the official records unless you obtain a new title. If another state issued your title, you need a duplicate title from that state. If you misplaced your title, ask the lienholder for a lien release.\n\n### Getting Title in New York\n\nNew York's ELT program differs from other states. In New York, the vehicle owner holds the title, and the lienholder gets an electronic lien notification. To get your title in New York, you need the lien release document and your original title certificate. Make out a check or money order for the fee, payable to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. Mail the three items to Lien Release at the Title Services office of the DMV in Albany, New York. The agency sends you the new title within 90 days of receiving your paperwork.\n\n### What to Do If You Can't Find the Lienholder\n\nIf your financial institution or lender merged with another lending institution, changed its name, moved, or went out of business, you might have trouble finding the lienholder. For help in finding an institutional lender to get a lien release in California, check the Financial Institution Listing section on the state's DMV website. \n\nIn New York, check for a lienholder's name and address online at the DMV  website. Look for the \"Registration/Check a Title or Lien Status\" page. You need the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), and the vehicle make, model, and year.\n\nMaking that final payment on your auto loan is a milestone. By knowing how to get the title after paying off a car loan, you're able to complete the process of buying a motor vehicle and can drive with confidence that your new car is all yours.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Licensing"],"ctaText":"Browse Vehicle Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-05-23T22:46:45.544Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/BoCsAMYvfMSnp2yzAZdII/e1f98b4eafc27e930caf1299f4a665fa/gap-insurance-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3inZ54BdNjN8InynWXcbyE/5aac7f6f9a22675e475a97a6e29c0053/gap-insurance-325-image.jpg","slug":"gap-insurance-worth-it","title":"Is Gap Insurance Worth It?","publication_date":"2019-05-21T11:23-08:00","content_summary":"Learn what gap insurance is, how it protects you from financial loss if your car is stolen or declared a total loss, and when you need it.","parent_page":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides","slug":"guides"},"categories":[{"name":"Buying Guides","description":"Guides that help buyers with their automotive purchase.","parentCategory":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides"}}],"category":{"name":"Buying Guides","description":"Guides that help buyers with their automotive purchase.","parentCategory":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides"}},"author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"body":"### What Is Gap Insurance?\n\nAs you're probably aware, your new vehicle starts to lose value as soon as you drive it off the car dealer's lot. Your new car continues to depreciate every day so that you lose up to 30 percent of the car's value within its first year. \n\nIf you've ever been in an accident or had your car stolen, you know that your auto insurance pays you for the depreciated value of the vehicle — that is, the amount the vehicle is worth after all that depreciation. Given that the standard rate of depreciation is 17.8 percent per year (up to the sixth year of your car's life), that means you could be in trouble if that unfortunate accident or theft should occur. \n\nSure, your insurance company will reimburse you for your loss. That's why you have auto insurance, after all. But if you don't get your car back in driveable condition, either due to theft or because it was declared a total loss, the amount of reimbursement you receive may not be enough to cover the cost of a new vehicle. And if you're still making car payments, your compensation may not even be enough to pay off the auto loan or lease, putting you upside down on your car loan.\n\nThat's where gap insurance comes in. Gap insurance is a secondary form of auto insurance that's specifically intended to cover the gap between what your damaged or stolen car is currently worth and what it would cost to put you in the new model of the same vehicle. \n\nHere's an interesting tidbit: While it would make sense that it's called \"gap\" insurance because it covers a financial gap, actually the \"gap\" in gap insurance stands for Guaranteed Asset Protection.\n\nWhen you understand how gap insurance works, you can make smart decisions when you shop for it.\n\n### What Does Gap Insurance Actually Cover?\n\nGap insurance stands alongside your liability, comprehensive, and collision insurance to provide extra coverage, including the deductibles on your other insurance coverage. There may be a cap on the deductible amount your gap insurance will cover. \n\nAlso, it protects you against negative equity in your car. Let's say you buy a new car for $25,000. The moment you drive your car off the dealer's lot, it loses several thousand dollars in value, and it continues losing value as it gets older. If a year later, you're in an accident, and your car is declared a total loss, your insurance company might declare that your vehicle is worth only $18,000. If you actually still owe, say, $21,000 on the car, you're now upside down on your car loan.\n\nWhat does that mean? Here's how it works. Your insurance company will make its reimbursement payment first to your credit union, bank, or the car dealer that loaned you the money to buy your car. That's because your bank or credit union is technically the owner of the vehicle until you've finished paying for it. If the insurance company's reimbursement payment doesn't cover the amount you still owe to your credit union or bank, then you're responsible for the rest. That's right: You don't have a car, you don't have money to buy a new car, and you actually owe money on the vehicle you no longer have.\n\nGap insurance steps up in this hypothetical example to help cover the $3,000 difference between the amount you owe on your car and the amount your insurance company will reimburse you for your loss, possibly including your entire deductible. Now you no longer owe any money to your old credit union or bank, and you're ready to start over without debt weighing you down.\n\n### Where Can You Buy Gap Insurance?\n\nYour own auto insurance company is likely to sell gap insurance. Ask your insurance agent if you can add it to your existing insurance policy. Adding gap insurance will add a small amount to your regular insurance payment.\n\nIn many cases, the car dealership where you bought your new car also makes gap insurance available. Your lender may also offer gap insurance. In both these cases, your payment for gap insurance would be added to your monthly loan payments.\n\nAlso, some companies sell standalone gap insurance that becomes an add-on to your basic auto insurance policy. Check out the offerings from the Nationwide, American Family and Travelers insurance companies. \n\nIf you've financed your car through your insurance company, as is sometimes possible, you may be able to get gap insurance through your insurer. If you have your insurance through the AAA or State Farm, or if you're a veteran or active member of the military with insurance coverage through USAA, ask them what they offer in terms of gap insurance.\n\nBuying gap insurance on a standalone basis may run you a flat fee of up to $300. That fee may go up to about $700 if you roll gap insurance into your loan. One of the least expensive ways to finance your gap insurance is to add it to your existing insurance policy, where you'll pay about $20 per year. Review your need for gap insurance each year, and cancel it if the numbers show you no longer need it.\n\n### Do You Need Gap Insurance?\n\nIf there's any chance that you might find yourself upside down on your car loan if your car is stolen or totaled, you should consider gap insurance. You're most likely to be in that position if your auto loan is a long-term one of five to seven years — and that's more common than it used to be. Experian points out that 66 months is the average term for a new car loan. And that means most people are likely to have negative equity in their cars at some point.\n\nTake a look at your auto financing. Does it include other products such as dealer-installed options or an extended service agreement? Or did you roll debt from a previous car loan into your current loan? If so, your loan includes payments that aren't tied to the value of your car, and that makes it more likely that you could end up upside down in the event of a loss.\n\nIf you didn't make a down payment when you bought your car, you also stand a more significant chance of having negative equity if your vehicle is a total loss, since that down payment adds to your equity in the car.\n\nSome new cars depreciate faster than others. If you have one of those makes or models, you could be surprised to learn that you're upside down. Check resources like the Kelley Blue Book or Edmunds to find out if you're driving one of these quick depreciators.\n\nYour car also depreciates faster if you put a lot of miles on it each year. Think about getting gap insurance if you drive more than 15,000 miles per year.\n\nFinally, gap insurance is a must-have if you lease your car rather than buying it. Some car leases require it. But check with your auto leasing company first, since many of them already include gap coverage.\n\nWhen is gap insurance not worth it? If you own your car outright and have no loan, then your standard insurance should cover any total loss. Or if your loan is equal to the value of your vehicle, again, your insurance will pay off your lender in full, meaning you can skip buying gap insurance.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Insurance"],"ctaText":"Browse Car Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-05-22T13:26:48.730Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7eQarX4QW78BMOgmcxBkpJ/9fc9a4e10b44be68609817c43d2e8085/dealer-installed-options-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1dFg3TVKDcgjbLFwLsYlYo/e5d36901baf28b5e8e03706fad39e994/dealer-installed-options-325-image.jpg","slug":"dealer-options","title":"Dealer Options - What You Need to Know","publication_date":"2019-05-20T11:48-08:00","content_summary":"Learn when dealer-installed options are worth the expense on your new car, which dealer options to avoid, and what options you have when negotiating.","parent_page":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides","slug":"guides"},"categories":[{"name":"Buying Guides","description":"Guides that help buyers with their automotive purchase.","parentCategory":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides"}}],"category":{"name":"Buying Guides","description":"Guides that help buyers with their automotive purchase.","parentCategory":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides"}},"author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"body":"### What Are Dealer Options?\n\nBuying a new car can sometimes feel overwhelming, what with the myriad of decisions you need to make. What model should you buy? Which color? What payment options are the best choice for you? And finally, the big question that can affect your bottom line significant: What optional equipment do you want on your new car?\n\nSome of that optional equipment comes as dealer-installed options. These are accessories that the car dealer chooses and adds. Sometimes it's difficult to know when you're looking at dealer options vs. factory-installed options. Here's a hint: Take a look at the window sticker. Typically, dealer options aren't included on the official window sticker. Instead, you may find a second window sticker that lists the dealer options.\n\n### Difference Between Factory Options and Dealer Options\n\nThe name of the different types of options tells you a lot. Factory-installed options are, not surprisingly, installed at the factory. The automaker approves these options, and they're listed on the official window sticker that all new cars must carry. They're also included in the automaker's warranty. You can expect the pricing of factory-installed options to stay the same from one dealer to the next since the automaker controls the prices.\n\nDealer options are different. The automaker doesn't have to approve them, and they're typically not covered by the factory warranty — which makes sense since they weren't added at the factory. And pricing can fluctuate quite a bit from one dealer to another since the dealers control the prices. In some cases, dealer options are significantly overpriced, since some car dealers use them to pad their profits.\n\n### Can You Turn Down Dealer-Installed Options?\n\nYes, you can try to turn down dealer options. Ask your car dealer to remove them and to delete the cost from the final price. Dealers may agree — or they may not. In some cases, it's impossible to remove a dealer option (How do you remove rustproofing, for instance?). Your only choices then are either to go ahead and pay for the dealer options, to refuse to pay for an unwanted option and demand that the car dealership removes the charge for the option (which the dealer may refuse to do), or to walk away from the deal.\n\n### Are Dealer Options Worth It?\n\nSometimes. While there are some add-on accessories and services that genuinely add to the value of your car (including at trade-in time or when you're ready to sell your car), others are just a way for car dealers to increase their profit margins. Of course, a dealer option that doesn't add to your car's actual value can be worth it if it makes owning your new vehicle more enjoyable. \n\nBut if you are indeed concerned with your trade-in value — or with your monthly car payment — it can be worthwhile to pay attention to which dealer options are worth the money, and which aren't. Take a look at some of the most common dealer options and their value.\n\n### Rustproofing\n\nNew car dealers offer this add-on because they can boost the price of the car by up to $1,200, but it's not necessary at all. Some automakers voice the corrosion-perforation warranty if a third party has provided a separate undercoating. All new cars now come with top-flight rustproofing installed at the factory, so you don't need it as a dealer option. Watch out for it included in so-called \"environmental protection packages\" that may also include paint sealant, sound deadening, and/or fabric protection.\n\n### Extended Warranties\n\nExtended warranties can be a good deal, especially if something significant goes wrong with your car after your factory warranty has expired. But you have many options when purchasing an extended warranty, and most of them are better than buying one as a dealer option. And you don't have to buy your extended warranty if you want one when you buy your new car. You can purchase one at any time.\n\nCheck out extended warranties provided by your auto manufacturer or even through your auto insurance agency rather than opting for a dealer-provided warranty. Dealer warranties often exempt the systems in a car that are most likely to need work (navigation systems are one good example), and they can be quite overpriced.\n\n### Fabric Protection\n\nOf course, you want to protect your new car's upholstery from becoming stained. But you can handle that yourself with a can of Scotchgard. That way, you're spending a few bucks rather than the $100-plus that the dealer is likely to charge you. And your car probably doesn't even need it, because modern vehicles typically use fabrics that wipe up quickly if you get to any spills right away.\n\n### Paint Protection\n\nAlong with fabric protection often comes paint protection, another popular add-on sold by new car dealers. Any new car's finish should easily last five years with typical care — the length of time that most paint protection packages are guaranteed. Waxing your car regularly provides plenty of protection, and the $1,000 or more that you might spend on paint protection could be better spent on touching up any little scratches you incur over your first five years with your car.\n\n### Vehicle Identification Number Etching\n\nSome car dealers offer this service, in which your vehicle identification number is chemically burned into one of your new car's windows. While your VIN is already available and identifiable on your vehicle, some insurance companies recommend this add-on. It may protect against auto theft or, more specifically, against the theft of your windshield. Check with your insurance company to see if they discount your comprehensive insurance if you have VIN etching. But also be aware that you can handle the etching yourself with an inexpensive DIY kit. Some insurance companies also offer this service for free.\n\n### Key Fob Replacement\n\nIf your new car comes standard with keyless entry or remote start, your new car dealer may offer you the dealer option of key replacement or key insurance. It's undoubtedly true that modern car keys and keyless entry/remote start fobs are expensive to replace or reprogram, and that many insurance policies don't cover them. However, check with your insurance company before you sign up for this dealer option, which can be pricey. They may offer coverage for a fraction of the dealer option price. And if you're primarily concerned with the possibility of getting locked out of your car, consider signing up with the AAA or another roadside assistance program.\n\n### Nitrogen in Your Tires\n\nYes, nitrogen seeps out of your tires at a lower rate than the standard air you pump in yourself at the gas station. It is slightly more stable under pressure as temperatures change. But unless you're prepping a NASCAR race car for a big race, you almost certainly don't need it. That extra pound of air pressure difference isn't going to affect how your tires wear or how your car handles. Save the $300 the new car dealer is charging for nitrogen, and buy an inexpensive tire gauge instead. If you keep your tire pressure healthy, you don't need the nitrogen. And even if you want nitrogen, your local tire shop is happy to fill your tires with it for only about $10.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Options"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-05-20T22:29:40.200Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5QQDkTLGFW5c3uR6blvSNx/3488d8a464ea031ce209a44584b68f84/top-15-american-muscle-cars-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7IMA9iANlrks6sS1d6LQ6n/e48425be53979b87cbb793c1dd15aa66/top-15-american-muscle-cars-325-image.jpg","slug":"american-muscle-cars","title":"Top 15 American Muscle Cars - New and Classic","publication_date":"2019-05-17T08:56-08:00","content_summary":"Find out the top 15 American muscle cars from the past and present.

The trend started in the 1960s when American automakers like Ford, Chevrolet, Dodge and Plymouth among others began taking massive, powerful engines and placing them between the wheels of smaller, lighter chassis. Performance became the name of the game, and these powerful beasts were leading the pack. Although the term \"muscle car\" is mostly associated with vehicles of this bygone era, modern rear-wheel-drive sports cars inspired by these extreme classic cars have started to adopt the term today.\n\n### 1964 Pontiac GTO\n\n![1964-pontiac-gto-image](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2jyE8pY6GmEC6uG0j0xCcG/60176b3583920bf59cd0011f2c81553e/1964-pontiac-gto-image.jpg)\n\nIt's always debatable which vehicle was the first American muscle car, but fingers often point to the GTO. Pontiac's performance car presented buyers with a big engine and an affordable price. Not only that, but the automaker marketed it directly on the performance angle. Pontiac also made a couple of rebel moves in the construction of the GTO by not following restrictions from GM on putting large engines in small cars and also by stealing the Ferrari name GTO, which stood for Gran Turismo Omologato and was supposed to indicate race cars with street-legal versions. The bold move quickly triggered an arms race from competing automakers such as Ford, Chrysler and even Buick. Pontiac continued to build on the GTO, making it bigger and more flashy, but it was eventually discontinued in 1974. It was revived in 2004 on an Australian-built coupe but dropped again in 2006. \n\n[View 1964 Pontiac GTO Listings](https://www.autolist.com/pontiac-gto#year_min=1964\u0026year_max=1964\u0026radius=any)\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 454\n\n![1970-chevrolet-chevelle-ss-454-image](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6RIgBPxyIVdSomA1xbqtOb/8d09b7a6316447e076638d7793e6a74b/1970-chevrolet-chevelle-ss-454-image.jpg)\n\nEven though the American muscle car era got started in the 1960s, the 1970s are considered to be the peak of the muscle car period. One of the primary representatives of that era was the 1970 Chevy Chevelle. The Chevelle came in two versions; the LS5 and the LS6. The former put out 360 horsepower, but the latter blew away the competition with an incredible for the time 450 horsepower. No other high-performance vehicle of the time was able to beat or even equal the LS6's power. The Chevelle had distinct muscle car lines, too. It was sleek with a slightly slanted back end and bulging hood to give the impression of speed and power. It looked like a sports car that would beat all comers, and it generally did.\n\n[View 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 454 Listings](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-chevelle#year_min=1970\u0026year_max=1970\u0026radius=any)\n\n### 1967 Chevrolet Camaro Z/28\n\n![1967-chevrolet-camaro-z28-image](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5o7lWCsHf4rJ6lkG3pc8fi/6d31fe24ace388e07c0af6de476b4772/1967-chevrolet-camaro-z28-image.jpg)\n\nThe original Z/28 was made for Trans Am racing and the name has since been added to various other high-performance Camaro models through the generations. It raced against similar hot cars like the Challenger and the Mustang Boss in the main showcase for sports cars of the day. The Trans American sedan series by the Sports Car Club of America is what entrenched the Mustang as the quintessential pony car. Chevy essentially built the Z/28 to take the Mustang down a notch, and it worked as the car won championships in both 1968 and 1969. The Z/28 had both powerful performance and handling, which helped it win.\n\n[View 1967 Chevrolet Camaro Z/28 Listings](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-camaro#year_min=1967\u0026year_max=1967\u0026radius=any)\n\n### 1970 Plymouth Barracuda Hemi\n\n![1970-plymouth-barracuda-hemi-image](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/TSzqQCMaaOb4m8jTJkcb9/4d8b56e374b1a9f28173a7cd9d99ec5f/1970-plymouth-barracuda-hemi-image.jpg)\n\nAs one of the top muscle cars of the peak 1970s era, the Barracuda Hemi featured a 426 cubic-inch engine with dual carburetors and the ability to put out 425 horsepower. The Barracuda Hemi also had a revised suspension that allowed it to withstand heavy acceleration. Like the Chevelle, the Barracuda had a profile that fit its speed and power. The front end was wide-set with a deep-set grille and split-channel air intake on the hood. The cabin had more of a low-profile look with less of a slanted back end. The sad part is that Plymouth didn't make very many Barracuda Hemis, which makes their present-day price very high compared to other classics.\n\n[View 1970 Plymouth Listings](https://www.autolist.com/plymouth#year_min=1970\u0026year_max=1970\u0026radius=any)\n\n### 1968 Ford Mustang GT\n\n![1968-ford-mustang-gt-image](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7qXy9bWux96CHFGWbKtHJh/a4ce7c8b79d3136620317709bb4f7490/1968-ford-mustang-gt-image.jpg)\n\nThe 1968 Mustang GT might be the true icon of the muscle car era. It is the vehicle that starred in the classic movie Bullitt alongside Steve McQueen. It featured in the movie's main car chase, which is still considered one of the best in movie history. Ford has never forgotten the iconic car either, unveiling its latest tribute with the 2018 version. Offered in Highland Green paint in a nod to the movie car, it also features a blackout grille and low-profile lines similar to the original car.\n\n[View 1968 Ford Mustang GT Listings](https://www.autolist.com/ford-mustang#year_min=1968\u0026year_max=1968\u0026radius=any)\n\n### 1969 Dodge Charger\n\n![1969-dodge-charger-image](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3mtAxrfXsphYY6qjkoe8J0/acf2d6bbf1d644cf31b27c003c098a27/1969-dodge-charger-image.jpg)\n\nAnother iconic car from the late '60s and early '70s was the 1969 Dodge Charger. Dodge presented this car to the American market with some different choices. The SE and R/T were the main models, and then the 500 and Daytona were the race models. There were also five V8 engines offered, including the Street Hemi, which put out 425 horsepower. The body style stayed the same across models, a two-door hardtop with long, sleek lines and a deep-set grille. The '69 model updated the '68 with a vertical grille divider. One of the most interesting facts about the Charger is that the Charger Daytona was the first vehicle to go over 200 mph top speed for NASCAR. The Daytona was specifically modified to be more aerodynamic and was extremely impressive for its time in that regard. NASCAR eventually changed its rule book and the Daytona's type was banned.\n\n[View 1969 Dodge Charger Listings](https://www.autolist.com/dodge-charger#year_min=1969\u0026year_max=1969\u0026radius=any)\n\n### 1969 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am\n\n![1969-pontiac-firebird-trans-am-image](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/aFmq1NmpTHnEy0N5TGFmE/097250e6a43c9381f298f362bd2023db/1969-pontiac-firebird-trans-am-image.jpg)\n\nPontiac's classic Firebird Trans Am became a legend partially due to its appearance in the 1976 movie, \"Smokey and the Bandit.\" It also became one of the few American muscle cars to survive past the 1970s. Despite its name, it never competed on the Trans American circuit. The original Trans Am was always white with polar blue racing stripes. Though it had many of the regular Firebird specs, one exclusive was the functional air inlets on the hood. These could even be closed by the driver. It only took three years for the Trans Am to replace the GTO as Pontiac's most popular muscle car.\n\n[View 1969 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am Listings](https://www.autolist.com/pontiac-firebirdr#year_min=1969\u0026year_max=1969\u0026radius=any)\n\n### 1969 Ford Mustang Boss 429\n\n![1969-ford-mustang-boss-429-image](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6cQDvFL57nSjN6dELdnT96/7aa72542d7af69c5ab01483e6f32bdde/1969-ford-mustang-boss-429-image.JPG)\n\nAnother muscle car designed specifically for NASCAR at the time, the 1969 Mustang Boss was a pretty exclusive vehicle. Less than 1,500 1969 Boss cars were made, which puts it in rare company for muscle cars in that year. Despite being hand-built for racing, the Boss never actually got to race for NASCAR. Featuring a massive 429 cubic-inch V8 engine, it only put out 375 horsepower. However, it could still rev up to 6,000 rpm. The standard car's had to be modified several times to get the big engine in. Unfortunately, it wasn't quite as fast as the other '69 big-block Mustangs, but it did make up for it somewhat in looks. The trunk spoiler and scooped hood gave the Boss its distinctive beastly design.\n\n[View 1969 Ford Mustang Boss 429 Listings](https://www.autolist.com/ford-mustang#year_min=1969\u0026year_max=1969\u0026radius=any)\n\n### 1992 Dodge Viper\n\n![1992-dodge-viper-image](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5qlLQ94BTswBvXl7xdnvhz/03e17aa20b3750ad5f317d4e19efea79/1992-dodge-viper-image.JPG)\n\nA more modern muscle car is the Dodge Viper. This sports car smashed onto the scene with a V10 engine and styling that somewhat resembled the Chevrolet Corvettes of the time. It was well-known for its bare-bones construction, which did not include traction control. It gained a reputation for being hard to drive as well. Those issues and its price tag likely shortened its lifespan. Dodge attempted to make up for that in the Viper's last generation with more comfort features and the needed traction control, but it didn't keep the Viper alive. Dodge gave it a well-deserved farewell by designing the Viper ACR, which was built for nothing but speed. It set incredible records at 13 different race tracks.\n\n[View 1992 Dodge Viper Listings](https://www.autolist.com/dodge-viper#year_min=1992\u0026year_max=1992\u0026radius=any)\n\n### 2016 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1\n\n![2016-chevrolet-camaro-zl1-image](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1SWorOMAdPgtxV5iexCbhE/d55194654cda9ca9067ecf343fdb5d2f/2016-chevrolet-camaro-zl1-image.JPG)\n\nThe ZL1 name has been typically attached to what was the fastest Camaro of the time. In 2016, this vehicle had a 6.2-liter V8 engine that put out 650 horses. This version of the Camaro was meant to perform alongside some of the best sports cars in the world, including the Z06 Corvette. It wasn't just fast either. The 2016 Camaro had high-performance handling due to an updated suspension and chassis.\n\n[View 2016 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 Listings](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-camaro#year_min=2016\u0026year_max=2016\u0026radius=any)\n\n### 1969 Pontiac GTO The Judge\n\n![1969-pontiac-the-judge-gto-image](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1nWyY8sHv9FvA4lyTe0nZ3/c0cf6ce559e260806df42875f89cbd92/1969-pontiac-the-judge-gto-image.jpg)\n\nAs previously mentioned, the Pontiac GTO triggered the muscle car trend with its original 1964 incarnation, but The Judge was the big upgrade. In 1968, other automakers had taken the bait and the muscle car market was rife with competition. The GTO had to get better. Instead of making a smaller, cheaper GTO, Pontiac stepped up with an even bigger car. The Judge had a standard 360 horsepower Ram Air III engine, and then a Ram Air IV upgrade with 370 horsepower. Pontiac briefly made a convertible Ram Air IV, but it was extremely limited to only five cars. The Judge had a very recognizable body design and it usually came in a bright reddish-orange. The trunk had a wing, the hood featured split air intakes and the grille had a vertical divider that was an extension of the body rather than the grille itself. The Judge made such a big splash that it even had a rock song written about it by Paul Revere and the Raiders.\n\n[View 1969 Pontiac GTO The Judge Listings](https://www.autolist.com/pontiac-gto#year_min=1969\u0026year_max=1969\u0026radius=any)\n\n### 1969 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1\n\n![1969-chevrolet-camaro-zl1-image](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/iPwEypKVWlnr4AV3lRmXk/7ae54444a69e17a1408ff93f2aaa0668/1969-chevrolet-camaro-zl1-image.jpg)\n\nThe original Camaro ZL1 came out for the 1969 model year and had the most powerful engine of the time for Chevrolet. This engine was the 427 V8, and it remains one of the most recognized Chevy engines. Many cars of the time had iron block engines, but this one had an aluminum block, which made it lighter. The ZL1 was marketed as having the standard 430 horsepower of the 427, but later tests revealed that the power of the ZL1's engine was a lot higher. As one of the rarest production cars from Chevy, the original ZL1 has vastly outlived its original price of $7,200 and remains one of the most classic muscle cars of its era.\n\n[View 1969 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 Listings](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-camaro#year_min=1969\u0026year_max=1969\u0026radius=any)\n\n### Ford Shelby Mustang GT350R (2016+)\n\n![2015-ford-shelby-mustang-gt350r-image](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5mBTljc7JoXNVo8OEHy3vt/577d9b14d0907d5d344d09032212f3fe/2015-ford-shelby-mustang-gt350r-image.jpg)\n\nFord attempted to rope in both American muscle car fans and European sports car enthusiasts with the 2016 Shelby Mustang GT350R. Taking inspiration from the original 1960s Shelby Mustang model, Ford gave it a 5.2-liter V8 engine meant to rev high, but the hardcore R version also added carbon fiber wheels and made the rear seats optional. The resulting vehicle was indeed racetrack-capable, but also very basic. It didn't need electronic help for speed. With powerful mechanics in place, it only required an experienced driver to fill in the rest.\n\n[View Ford Shelby Mustang GT350R Listings](https://www.autolist.com/ford-mustang#year_min=2016\u0026year_max=\u0026radius=any\u0026trim%5B%5D=Shelby+GT350R)\n\n### 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon\n\n![2018-Dodge-Challenger-SRT-Demon](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7wiDMV4fW3QnQkaiHGKIeB/3ef7c5965e20593d1ab49a99ab7dfb71/2018-Dodge-Challenger-SRT-Demon.jpg)\n\nThe Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat was already a pretty beastly machine with 707 horsepower, but the SRT Demon variant took it to another level. Nearly every muscle car automaker has made cars for the track, but Dodge went a bit further by making the Demon able to navigate the natural state of the muscle car on the drag strip. The figures are pretty incredible with a 9.65-second quarter mile going 140 mph. On its way there, the Demon can go zero to 60 mph in 2.3 seconds while pulling a wheelie. The Demon's speed comes from a 6.2 liter supercharged Hemi V8 engine that puts out 808 horsepower under normal circumstances. Give the same car 100-octane racing fuel and the Demon puts out 840 horses.\n\nAlong with the speed, the Demon employs a few tricks previously reserved solely for race cars. The car has a standard single seat, and it has a transmission brake to lock it on the starting line to get off faster. The dedication to sheer drag racing ability in the Demon is something that won't be seen again for a while.\n\n[View Dodge Challenger Listings](https://www.autolist.com/dodge-challenger#year_min=2017\u0026year_max=2017\u0026trim%5B%5D=SRT+Demon\u0026radius=any)\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### 2019 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1\n\n![2019-Chevrolet-Corvette-ZR1–VIR-Lap-Record-Holder-01](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5kOQ4iVXOw9yryh10qNMkV/cd3c8fbc5f8b2dc02188b611053bee42/2019-Chevrolet-Corvette-ZR1___VIR-Lap-Record-Holder-01.jpg)\n\nAlthough the Corvette has always been painted with more of a sports car brush than a muscle car brush, it's still an iconic American speedster. Chevy has made some \"Vettes\" over the years that easily wear both titles. The 2019 Corvette line, however, includes the high-performance ZR1, which is the most powerful variants ever made. It features a supercharged 6.2-liter V8 engine with 755 horsepower and 715 lb.-ft. of torque. This amount puts even the Dodge Hellcat and Z06 to shame. It has a top speed of 210 mph. The ZR1 is not the Corvette to be messed with. At least based on the numbers. Not only that, but Chevy has given drivers the option of a seven-speed manual transmission or eight-speed automatic. Its handling is also described as accomplished, with the inclusion of magnetic ride control, traction management and an electronic limited slip differential. The ZR1 can run with some of the best muscle cars in the past and present.\n\n[View 2019 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 Listings](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-corvette#year_min=2019\u0026year_max=2019\u0026radius=any\u0026trim%5B%5D=ZR1)","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["American Cars"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-05-17T22:15:38.691Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/ay0FiTybLrVLxJAN57CkY/543498773fb15432a9c49778d0ce27c3/what-is-negative-equity-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5Btx9UYHktKnFM6nc3X2E5/093decd15d3674f2572933cdd6e30929/what-is-negative-equity-325-image.jpg","slug":"negative-equity-car","title":"What is Negative Equity for a Car?","publication_date":"2019-05-15T09:57-08:00","content_summary":"Learn what negative equity means when you buy a new or used car.

You have negative equity when your car's value is less than what you owe on your car loan. A negative equity car situation can develop in several ways. Fortunately, with a few smart moves, you can get out from under your upside-down auto loan position or avoid it in your next car purchase.    \n\n### What Causes Negative Equity?\n\nWhen you made a down payment and took out your auto loan for your new car purchase, the vehicle's market value was higher than the loan amount. Interest accrued as you made your monthly payments, increasing the total amount you had to pay on the loan. At the same time, the car's value was decreasing. If the car's Blue Book or market value drops below the total amount of principal and interest remaining on the loan, the result is a negative equity car. This condition is also called being underwater or upside-down.   \n\n### The Negative Equity Car Problem\n\nBeing in an upside-down car loan becomes a problem if you need to pay your car loan off quickly and you realize the car is not worth the loan balance. Another negative equity car problem arises if you're involved in an accident and the insurance company writes your vehicle off as a total loss. You receive the car's value, but it's not enough to pay the loan. You're stuck with no car, yet you are responsible for the remaining loan. How did you end up upside-down?        \n\n### A Low Down Payment Can Lead to Being Upside-Down\n\nMaking a low down payment contributes to an upside-down car loan situation. Combining a small down payment with an extended loan term increases the risk of being upside down on your new loan. If you buy a new vehicle for $30,000 and put only 5% down, which is $1,500, your loan amount before interest is $28,500. With a 60-month loan, your principal car payment is $475 monthly, before interest.\n\nIn the first 30 days after purchase, a new vehicle is likely to lose 10% of its value, which in this case is $3,000. So, by the time you're ready to make your first new car loan payment 30 days after your purchase, you're upside down on your loan. Your new car is worth only $27,000, and you owe $28,500, plus interest. You have $1,500 negative equity. In the first year after purchase, your car might lose 20% or more of its original value, which means by the end of the first year, your new vehicle might be worth only $23,000, but you owe $23,275, plus interest. The Kelley Blue Book trade-in value and resale value of your new car are likely to continue falling by 10% each year for the first five years after purchase.\n\nA negative equity car has a loan-to-value ratio (LTV) of greater than 100%. If your vehicle is valued at $27,000 and your loan amount is $28,500, your car's LTV is 105.5% percent. Putting more money down when buying a new vehicle gives you smaller monthly payments, a shorter loan term, or both. Aim for putting 20% down when you buy a new or used car to help cover the depreciation for the first year. When you're paying a smaller loan amount off in less time, less interest accrues, and there's a lower risk of your car being worth less than the remaining loan amount. You will have a vehicle with an LTV ratio of less than 100%, which is what you want.\n\n### Interest Rates Matter in Negative Equity\n\nWhen your car loan includes a high-interest rate, it contributes to the possibility of negative equity. Shopping around for low rates can help avoid negative equity, and credit unions are an excellent option for securing low-rate auto loans. If you authorize automatic withdrawals for loan payments from your checking or savings account, your credit union or bank may offer you a better interest rate than a car dealer, even if your credit score is not the best.\n\n### Rollover Loans Can Put You Underwater\n\nIf you had negative equity in your previous car loan and bought your current car with a rollover loan, you continued the underwater loan situation. Car dealers use the tactic of rolling an old loan balance into an existing loan when car buyers come in with negative equity. When you trade in a car every two years or so, you're creating an upside-down loan situation, because of the car's value decline and the more substantial portion of your monthly payment is going to interest, rather than reducing the principal. Keeping your car longer enables you to reduce your loan balance as the car's depreciation rate slows, so you create positive equity.\n\n### Why You Want Positive Equity\n\nPositive equity is the opposite of negative equity. You have positive equity when your car's value is greater than the amount of your loan balance. Like home equity loans, positive equity in your vehicle gives you a resource from which to draw when you want to trade in your current vehicle and buy a new car. Car buying is more straightforward with positive equity than with negative equity, especially when you want to trade in a vehicle. If you owe $7,000 on your current vehicle and it has a Blue Book trade-in value of $10,000, you have $3,000 in positive equity, which gives you at least $3,000 toward the purchase of your next car.\n\n### Trading In Your Current Car With Negative Equity\n\nWhile it's better to have positive equity in your current car if you want to trade in a car, it's possible to work a trade-in for a new or used car even though you're upside-down on your car loan. To find out exactly how much negative equity you have, subtract your current loan payoff balance from your car's current value. Contact your lender for your exact payoff figure, and check sources such as Edmunds and Kelley Blue Book for reliable car valuation. For the trade to work, you need to give the car dealer your current car and the amount of negative equity. If you owe $7,000 and your car's trade-in value is $5,000, you have negative equity of $2,000. You give the car dealer $2,000 cash and your $5,000 car.  \n\n### Selling a Car to Get Rid of An Upside-Down Car Loan\n\nSelling your car is an excellent way of eliminating your upside-down car loan. Put it in the best possible condition appearance-wise with proper washing, waxing, and detailing inside and out to attract buyers and bring the best price. Make sure your vehicle is in good mechanical condition, but don't spend a lot of money on things that won't bring you a return. Check with your lender to find out how to pay off the loan and get the title to the buyer once the deal is sealed. Do not accept a personal check or a money order from the buyer. You want cash or a cashier's check. If possible, take someone with you that you trust and meet the buyer at the bank.\n\n### Ways to Avoid Negative Equity Cars\n\nIn considering your next car purchase, avoid car loans that last more than five years. With a down payment of 20% or more and a loan term of 36 or 48 months, you're likely to build positive equity quickly. If you have bad credit, plan to improve your credit score. Pay off other accounts, make payments such as rent, mortgage, and utility bills on time, check your credit report for errors, and write letters to the credit bureaus to correct them. Taking these steps should raise your credit score and qualify you for lower interest rates, another way to avoid an upside-down car loan. \n\nBe wise about the car you choose. Buying a used car may be the right move because it has gone through the new car depreciation cycle. Sites such as Edmunds and Kelley Blue Book provide accurate information about car makes and models that hold their resale value. In your research, pay attention to data about problems owners have reported as well as vehicle recalls by manufacturers.\n\nIf you have a negative equity car, you have options for getting out of the situation. With research and patience, you can relieve yourself of the burden and ensure your next car purchase keeps you right-side up in your car loan and on the road.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Financing and Loans","Definitions"],"ctaText":"Browse Car Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-05-16T23:55:50.167Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6fnUv1QGMfTLoEXcEom8tK/b61fe88165bd8f923a5f0e2fe659aac4/car-make-model-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6tCvySs2De8FoNZSFWKjmM/90e96978595511b45d3d3d29154f7d54/car-make-model-325-image.jpg","slug":"car-make-and-model","title":"Car Make and Model: What Does it Mean?","publication_date":"2019-05-14T11:45-08:00","content_summary":"Find out what is the model of a car and what the specific car make and model means for the value of your vehicle or for insurance purposes.","parent_page":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides","slug":"guides"},"categories":[{"name":"Buying Guides","description":"Guides that help buyers with their automotive purchase.","parentCategory":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides"}}],"category":{"name":"Buying Guides","description":"Guides that help buyers with their automotive purchase.","parentCategory":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides"}},"author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"body":"Car make and model are both terms used to identify and describe vehicles. Make is essentially a short term for an automaker, which means the company that makes the vehicle. Toyota, Ford, Chevrolet, and Honda are all examples of automakers or car makes. So what is the model of a car? Model is the specific type of vehicle produced by the automaker. For instance, a Camry is a model of Toyota, and a Civic is a model of Honda. Other terms to describe cars include the model year, body style and trim level.\n\n### Understanding Car Makes\n\nThe manufacturers and large companies that produce different car makes are typically multinational corporations with more than one location. Nevertheless, they are strongly associated with their home countries. For example, Nissan, Honda, Subaru, Mazda, and Toyota are often referred to as Japanese automakers, despite having many satellite branches around the globe. Similarly, Hyundai and Kia are associated with Korea, which is their home country. Ford, Chevrolet, and Chrysler are examples of American car makers. Volkswagen, Fiat, Porsche, and BMW are examples of car makers located in Europe and strongly associated with Europe, despite being popular around the world. Some consumers have a strong preference for particular automakers and will only buy from that brand.\n\nAnother thing to remember is that sometimes car makes will be made by the same company. For example, Acura is the luxury brand of Honda, and Lexus is the luxury brand of Toyota. These vehicles are luxury cars and differ from the car models found under their parent company brands.\n\n### Understanding Car Models\n\nCar model, on the other hand, refers to different types of cars found within one car brand. Car models have distinct names within the brand to differentiate them from other vehicles in the lineup. Sometimes car models have specific proper names such as a GMC Yukon. Other times, the car model might just be a number or letter or a combination such as the Audi Q3. Some of the more famous car model names include the Mustang, Corvette, Prius, Explorer, and Beetle. Car model names are important to distinguish vehicles as sometimes car makers release very similar vehicles. For example, the GMC Yukon and the Chevrolet Tahoe are very similar vehicles and, despite the different brands, are owned by the same company.\n\n### Differences Between Car Models\n\nDespite car models being a more precise way to identify a vehicle besides just the car make, it may not be precise enough in many applications. Depending on the year and trim of a car model, it could be radically different and treated differently in terms of buying or selling, shopping for car insurance or even registering the vehicle. For example, various trims and model years of vehicles may have different options such as safety features, engine size, and transmission among others. This affects the value of the vehicle and can change the type of quote you get for car insurance. \n\n### Car Model Body Styles\n\nThe same car model might also include different body styles under the same name. For example, a single passenger car model might offer a sedan, convertible, wagon and coupe version with the same name. An SUV crossover might also be referred to as a hatchback. The body style refers to the general shape and function of the vehicle. Identifying a Toyota sedan, for example, would narrow it down to cars with four doors. A Mitsubishi coupe is likely to be used to distinguish a two-door vehicle under that brand name.\n\n### Trim Levels For Car Models\n\nAlong with body styles, most car models also have at least a few different trim levels. For example, the 2019 Dodge Charger has the following trim level options: SXT, GT, R/T, SXT AWD, Scat Pack, and SRT Hellcat. Trim levels can be used in a tiered method where the lowest trim is the vehicle with the least amount of options while the luxury trim is at the top with the most options. However, sometimes trim levels are used to distinguish a vehicle's different use category. In the example used above, the SRT Hellcat is a top-level sportscar trim. In another case, the Rubicon is a Jeep Wrangler trim designed more for off-roading. Some car makes logically distinguish trim levels while others have to be decoded. Mercedes-Benz is one of these that uses a combination of letters and numbers. The C 300 and the AMG C 43 are both C Class car models but are different trims.\n\n### Car Model Year\n\nCar model years are another important way to distinguish vehicles and assess their value. Car makers often completely redesign car models and the year is a meaningful way to know this. However, it's important to remember that the model year does not necessarily indicate when the car was manufactured. For example, cars from the 2019 model year were available to purchase back in 2018. So if a redesign of a specific car model occurred for the 2019 model year, it was most likely manufactured in 2018.\n\n### Car Makes By The Same Manufacturer\n\nAs previously mentioned, some car manufacturers actually have more than one brand under their label. However, these brands are distinct car makes, and it would be incorrect to call an Acura MDX a Honda MDX. They are also not interchangeable, so you can't refer to a Honda Civic as an Acura Civic. In some cases, like with General Motors, the other brands are due to mergers with other companies in the past. GM has acquired Buick and Cadillac in the past, and these are considered GM brands in the present. However, at one point they were their own brands. This is different from Toyota, which created Lexus for the luxury car market and Scion to target an economy market.\n\n### How To Determine Your Car's Make and Model\n\nCar makes are identified by logos and by their name. You can always find both on your vehicle in one place or another. The emblem appears prominently on the grille for example. The car model is usually also indicated somewhere on the vehicle, but in the case that it's not, it will also be on the registration and owner's manual.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Definitions"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-05-15T21:05:19.626Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/64TXyYrriDtaKOOprq7ixo/d23fdd015608614017a13eb6f712efc8/lease-for-car-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1EsZ51Sc5u0RT2AXPVlJAT/440582ee3d03df60272843521ebf8908/lease-for-car-325-image.jpg","slug":"what-is-a-lease","title":" What is a Lease for a Car?","publication_date":"2019-05-13T10:42-08:00","content_summary":"A car lease lets you use a car for a few years while you pay for its decline in value.

Similar to how rent payments work, the lessee usually pays monthly lease payments along with other charges, such as a one-time security deposit, specified in the terms of the lease. Leasing lets you enjoy the convenience of a car for a while without having to pay the full price for it.\n\n### What is a Lease, and How Do You Lease a Car?\n\nTo lease a car, just visit a dealership with a vehicle in mind, and ask to lease it. Using your credit score and other criteria as benchmarks, the dealer then draws up a monthly payment plan for your new lease and asks for a down payment. This down payment is usually much smaller than the 20 percent of a car's value you're expected to pay when buying it new. When the lease term expires, you can bring the car back to the dealer, ending your monthly payments, or you can buy the car for its residual value — namely, the amount left over after its depreciation while in your hands. Leasing is ideal if you don't want to pay for an entire car or if you want to drive something outside of your usual price range for a time. A lease agreement usually stipulates how many miles you can drive per year (10,000 to 15,000 is common) and requires you to take good care of the car so it doesn't depreciate too quickly. When your lease contract expires, you can lease a new car right away.\n\nLeasing a car is similar to leasing real estate, such as a house, office space or commercial real estate, in that both car and real estate lease agreements feature much longer terms than rental contracts. Even six-month-term leases are short by lease standards. Unlike residential leases or commercial leases for property, though, you're expected to negotiate down from the sticker price of the vehicle to a capitalized cost, or \"cap cost.\" Typically, you can settle on a much smaller cap cost than you might think. In addition to paying for the car's depreciation every month, keep in mind that you also have to pay the lessor a bit of interest every month in exchange for tying up their capital. At the end of the lease, you may also have to pay wear-and-tear fees, plus repair fees, if necessary. Also, you may get stuck with disposal fees, if you decide not to buy the car, not to mention any charges for late payments or for returning the vehicle earlier than the term of the lease.\n\n### The Advantages of Leasing a Car\n\nLeasing a car has many advantages over buying one. For one, lease payments tend to be lower than car loan payments, so you can afford to lease a car that's more luxurious than what you could afford to buy. Also, you don't have to pay the sales tax for the whole car right away. Instead, you pay a sales tax on each lease payment. There are many kinds of leases out there, but most by-the-month leases for cars are less complicated than car purchases. Besides, you don't have to worry about the long-term value of the vehicle, since you get to trade it in once the lease contract is over. One of the other significant leasing perks is that you can try out a wide variety of cars by leasing a different make and model every few years. You don't have to worry about buyer's remorse if the vehicle doesn't work for you, and you don't have to figure out how to sell the car when you want to trade up or repair the vehicle once the warranty expires. When leasing, you're most likely always going to be on a warranty, and, since you can still lease new cars, you don't have to worry about more than routine maintenance. Leasing is especially useful for businesses that need to transport goods or people but can't afford the cost of a new car. Since businesses are often short-lived, leasing the car hedges against the risk of getting stuck with a significant expense should the business fail.\n\n### The Drawbacks to Leasing a Car\n\nLeasing isn't without its downsides, though. After all, you don't own the car despite all the payments you make on it unless you decide to buy it for the residual value. Since the residual value is determined at the outset, you can't renegotiate it at the end of the contract if you think it's too high. Plus, since you don't own the car, you can't sell it whenever you want and use the money to fund a new vehicle purchase. Perhaps most frustrating of all is the fact that you never stop making payments when you lease, whereas, when you've paid off a car, you no longer have to make such payments.\n\nFor this reason, a regular lessee is apt to pay more money over a lifetime than someone who buys a new car every decade. Moreover, you might be surprised by how much interest you have to pay long-term. Even if the interest per month seems small, it adds up. Another drawback to leasing is that the penalties are steep. For each mile you drive beyond your allotted amount, you may have to pay an extra 10 to 15 cents, although you can negotiate a higher allotment for a higher lease payment. The penalties for excessive wear-and-tear are also high, so you need to keep your car clean and unscathed as much as possible, which might keep you on edge.\n\n### Mistakes to Avoid When Leasing a Car\n\nLeasing a car is tricky, so it pays to keep alert for any mistakes you might make while doing it. Perhaps most importantly, you want to get gap insurance. That's the insurance that covers you if your car is totaled or stolen while you're leasing it and the car insurance payment doesn't cover the entire amount on the lease. Ask the lessor to include gap insurance coverage at the outset, or find a lessor who's willing to do so. You don't want to get stuck with a big bill for a car you don't own. Another mistake you might make is to pay too much for a lease. $2,000 is about the most you should spend on a down payment. Sure, a lower down payment means higher monthly payments, but this approach means you don't lose all the money you put down if the car is totaled, since the lessor, not you, get the insurance payment in that situation.\n\nSimilarly, you should figure out how many miles you drive each year, so you don't agree to a lower mileage allotment than you need. When leasing, make sure you don't lease past the warranty period as well. If you need to lease for a long time, get an extended warranty.\n\nLeasing is a convenient way to get hold of a car without the high cost and complexity of buying one, as long as you know all the risks and trade-offs. Some lessors even have flexible-lease programs in which you can lease a vehicle for a few months at a time and keep extending the lease for as many periods as you want. For millions of people in the U.S., leasing is the way to go.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Definitions","Financing and Loans"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-05-13T14:40:11.072Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4Pw8dcoZJ77GRdWPPwYq6D/a3c5437c21e83623b1e74c4c715c6cf5/what-does-suv-stand-for-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4Vo3WDwu5N3r0AmU0sSqi2/bef440f1fc5cd091bef7dbabec6d8d1b/what-does-suv-stand-for-325-image.jpg","slug":"what-does-suv-stand-for","title":"What Does SUV Stand For?","publication_date":"2019-05-10T09:05-08:00","content_summary":"The word \"SUV\" means \"sport utility vehicle.\" It's evolved over the decades and led to many variations, including slang and regional terms.","parent_page":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides","slug":"guides"},"categories":[{"name":"Buying Guides","description":"Guides that help buyers with their automotive purchase.","parentCategory":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides"}}],"category":{"name":"Buying Guides","description":"Guides that help buyers with their automotive purchase.","parentCategory":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides"}},"author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"body":"\"SUV\" stands for \"sport-utility vehicle,\" a marketing term that covers a broad range of rugged-looking, four-wheel-drive vehicles with off-road capabilities and a light-truck feel. Also called \"sport-utes,\" among other terms, sports utility vehicles are some of the most popular family vehicles in the U.S. Their large interior spaces, powerful towing capacities and three rows of seating combine the storage and hauling benefits of pickup trucks with the sleekness and comfort of station wagons.\n\n### What Does SUV Stand For, and What Are SUVs?\n\n\"SUV\" is a loose term, as it can include vehicles ranging from car-like crossover SUVs with minimal offroading capabilities to more Jeep-like SUVs designed for rough terrain. Both full-size and small SUVs typically share high ground clearance and all-wheel-drive. Initially, sport utility vehicles were built on truck chassis, but most modern SUVs feature unibody frames in which the floors, bodies and chassis all form a single structure. \n\nIn terms of both look and feel, an SUV resembles a truck, minivan and average American family car smashed together. The U.S., along with several other countries, classifies SUVs as light trucks rather than cars, giving them more relaxed fuel efficiency standards as a result. The term \"sport utility\" isn't a technical term. It just means the vehicle has both a relaxed, outdoorsy quality and is good at getting things done. \n\nAlthough built for driving on rough surfaces, such as dirt roads or even hills, SUVs are more often driven on city roads, much like any old estate car. Historical offroaders had two doors, but most modern SUVs have four or five doors to accommodate families. \n\nSUVs are nearly two-fifths of the world's passenger car market, as of 2019, having bounced back from a down period during the Great Recession. The global supply of SUVs is projected to double between 2015 to 2025, and they've primarily supplanted other types of large family vehicles in the automotive market, including station wagons. \n\nWhile SUVs don't have the most exceptional fuel economy, they have robust engines that don't tax easily. SUVs also have high seating positions and centers of gravity, and they tend to divide into models built for hauling heavy loads and excellent offroad capability and models made for sleek looks and secure handling.\n\n### How Broad Is the Word \"SUV\"?\n\nPeople confuse many types of big family vehicles, such as multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs), with SUVs, so it's worth comparing the differences between them. Also called \"minivans,\" MPVs are similar to SUVs in that they can carry five to seven people and have ample room for luggage, but they tend to be shorter in length than SUVs and have shorter hoods, and they're not intended as offroad vehicles. \n\nSimilarly, sedans are spacious like SUVs, but they also lack offroad capabilities, and they don't fit more than five people. Hatchbacks are similar to other road cars in these respects, but lack extended trunks, instead favoring shared space for passengers and cargo. \n\nIn addition, SUVs can be broken down into mini or subcompact SUVs, such as the Hyundai Santa Fe, which have minimal offroading capabilities; compact SUVs, such as the Honda CRV; mid-size SUVs, such as the Toyota Highlander or Ford Explorer, which are some of the most popular family SUVs; and large SUVs, such as the Chevy Tahoe. \n\nCrossover SUVs, or crossover utility vehicles (CUVs), are yet another category, combining the heavy-duty SUV feel with the technology and underlying platforms of passenger cars. The Mazda CX-5 or Nissan Rogue are both crossover SUVs. In the U.S., crossovers are sometimes grouped with cars, but other countries strictly consider them SUVs. In short, \"SUV\" is a broad category.\n\n### Where Did the Word \"SUV\" Originate, and How Has It Evolved?\n\nThe term \"sport-utility vehicle\" spread in the 1980s, when American Motors Corporation lobbied the U.S. Congress to make a separate category for vehicles that were neither trucks nor passenger cars but had elements of both. Originally, the term had a slash, as in \"sport/utility vehicle,\" to emphasize the dual nature of the SUV. Sometimes the term had a hyphen instead, as in \"sport-utility vehicle.\" \n\nBefore SUVs showed up, people sometimes used the term \"utility wagon\" for tough, roomy station wagons such as the 1930s Chevrolet Suburban, which is the ancestor of modern SUVs. Today, the word \"SUV\" has some baggage. Many people associate sport utility vehicles with materialism and pollution, as they're not very fuel-efficient, and their large designs suggest a desire for status. For this reason, \"crossover\" and \"CUV\" have become popular stand-ins for \"SUV,\" even when the SUV in question isn't a crossover. \n\nIn the automotive world, popular classifications don't always map onto official ones. People in various countries used to refer to all light, four-wheel-drive vehicles as \"Jeeps\" or \"Land Rovers,\" even though both terms refer to specific brands. That's because Jeeps and Land Rovers were common in World War II, where they demonstrated exceptional ruggedness and offroad capability, and because the Jeep Cherokee introduced in 1984 is widely seen as the first true SUV. \n\nRecently, however, \"SUV\" has become a catchall term around the world for such vehicles. There are also many slang variations on \"SUV,\" most of them derogatory. For example, \"FUV\" plays on the F-word to suggest contempt for the working class, while \"land destroyer\" and \"urban assault vehicle\" invoke the somewhat aggressive look of the SUV. Other pejorative terms for SUVs include \"portable living room,\" \"yuppiemobile,\" \"lardwagon,\" \"truck beast,\" \"soccer mom\" and \"Lincoln aggravator\" (derived from \"Lincoln Navigator\"). \n\nRegional terms for SUVs also abound. For example, in Melbourne, Australia, such vehicles are commonly called \"Toorak Tractors,\" after the affluent Melbourne suburb of Toorak. Norwegians call SUVs \"Stock Exchange Tractors\" for a similar effect, and Londoners call them \"Chelsea Tractors\" after the wealthy suburb in West London. \n\nAlthough \"SUV\" just stands for \"sport utility vehicle,\" the term describes a loose category with many vehicle types, from mini SUVs and subcompacts to crossovers and large SUVs. Sport-utility vehicles are some of the most popular passenger vehicles in the world, and their broad range of nicknames shows their diversity of styles and functions.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["SUVs","Definitions"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/suv","modified_date":"2019-05-12T14:01:14.715Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/71HG0GOfZSnRsm5AzY2xRA/104e44f950816d72425af879a565b1d9/how-often-change-oil-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1Yis0e4vBX6y4neMTz5r5j/46f0b86ddc8f0fa2c592d4bff3ab7e0a/how-often-change-oil-325-image.jpg","slug":"how-often-change-oil","title":"How Often Should You Change Your Oil?","publication_date":"2019-05-09T10:37-09:00","content_summary":"The standard recommendation of changing your motor oil every 3,000 miles no longer applies.

And this was true of most vehicles at one time. However, with changes in engine design and the emergence of modern lubricants, it is not unusual for a car to go much, much longer before needing an oil change. In fact, for engines that use full synthetic oil, it is possible under the right circumstances to avoid an oil change for up to five times the traditional recommendation. No matter the vehicle, the interval between oil changes depends on the age of the car, the type of oil used, and the driving conditions that the vehicle regularly undergoes. Let's look at what all car owners need to know about oil change intervals so that you can be sure your vehicle gets the TLC it needs to run its best. \n\n### Oil Changes for Older Cars\n\nThe traditional 3,000-mile oil change rule was a typical recommendation years ago when oil change intervals were based mainly on the number of miles driven. But much like those old clunky car phones and cassette tape decks in older cars, recommendations change. Cars from about 2007 and earlier that are used for normal driving conditions, most experts now recommend changing the oil every six months or 5,000 miles, whichever occurs first.\n\nTypically, an older car has one of two possible maintenance schedules: one for vehicles driven under normal conditions and one for cars that are operated in more extreme conditions, such as in severe weather or under lots of heavy acceleration or hauling. Harsh driving conditions include being driven primarily for short trips of five miles or less, driven mainly in stop-and-go situations, towing a trailer or carrying heavy loads, or driving in a climate that is extremely dusty, hot or cold. If you frequently drive your car under severe service conditions, then you will need to go by the standard rule of changing the oil every three months or 3,000 miles. The owner's manual for your older car will help you determine the best oil change interval and engine oil type for your particular vehicle. \n\n### Oil Changes for Newer Cars\n\nNew cars (from 2008 onward) generally have greater oil change intervals than older vehicles due to their use of synthetic blend, multi-grade, low-viscosity, and other newer generation resource-conserving motor oils that maximize a car's fuel economy and minimize friction. These motor oils are formulated to last longer before viscosity breakdown when compared to old-school 10W30, 10W40 and so on, thus their longer service life.\n\nThe number of miles you can drive your late model car and the expected oil life for your new car is generally mentioned in your owner's manual. These figures can vary widely. For example,  Toyota Camry 2.5-liter 4-cylinder models go typically 10,000 miles between oil changes. BMW cars that use synthetic oil can go up to 15,000 miles. New car oil changes require that the proper oil is used, based on the model and make of the car; it must be the correct SAE viscosity grade and automaker's recommendations. \n\n### Oil Life Monitors\n\nIf your vehicle is equipped with an oil life monitor, it is easy to determine when your car is due for an oil change. These monitors come on many modern vehicles from major manufacturers, and they base their recommendations on things like the number of cold starts, climate conditions, engine temperatures, and vehicle speed. Some owners of vehicles equipped with such monitors have indicated that their vehicles' monitors sometimes suggest that they can safely drive even more miles past the recommended intervals for changing the oil. \n\n### Why Do Oil Changes Matter?\n\nMotor oil’s significance cannot be underestimated. Just like the blood that runs through your veins has important jobs to do in your body, the oil in your car has many vital tasks. Your car’s oil cools and lubricates the hundreds of moving parts that keep your vehicle in good running shape. It protects the car’s engine, preventing contaminants and dirt from forming sludge that can result in engine wear, potential damage and reduced performance. It seals off gaps, reducing contamination by unburned fuel and water. Motor oil also prevents corrosion due to acid or moisture that might otherwise make their way into your car’s engine.\n\nDue to the constant work that motor oil does in your engine, it gets dirty. Moreover, once motor oil is “spent,” the additives in the oil that power its magical ability to keep your motor running become depleted. These additives include anti-wear agents that form a protective coating with metal surfaces to protect the life of your engine. Detergents that reduce the formation of contaminants and inhibitors that prevent corrosion and rust from forming are also depleted. They can lead to your vehicle experiencing breakdowns in the components of the engine. The oil’s friction modifiers also become depleted over time, which results in reduced fuel economy. And last but not least, viscosity index improvers in the oil are reduced, resulting in thicker oil that doesn’t do its job as efficiently.\n\n### \"But My Quick Lube Guy Recommends It\"\n\nWell, of course, he does! Your friendly (and perhaps, well-meaning) oil change guy may still stick wholeheartedly to the old recommendation of changing your oil every 3,000 miles. They may also do a good job convincing you that your car needs these frequent oil changes. It is, after all, in their best interests. Oil changes are his bread and butter. But bear in mind that your best resource for determining how often to change your oil is the manufacturer of the vehicle. The manufacturer is vested in keeping your car running great for as long as possible. The automaker wants you as a repeat customer and doesn't want to pay for any repairs that fall under your warranty. For these reasons, the manufacturer's recommendations should trump those of Moe the Mechanic downtown.\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\nNot all cars need to have their oil changed every 3,000 miles. And most car makers agree, according to research conducted by Edmunds. Automakers are now recommending, for the most part, that cars have an oil change between 7,500 miles and 10,000 miles. One big name in the industry, GM, suggests changing the oil at least annually, even if the oil service indicator warning never flashes. Although you can't harm your car by giving it a fresh oil change before its need for one, it can be a waste of money. Not to mention that it is also bad for the environment since that old spent motor oil has to be disposed of or recycled when it was still useful for many more miles. \n\nNonetheless, if you are a staunch believer in frequent oil changes, then the thought of driving your car for 15,000 miles without one may not sit well with you. But perhaps there is an excellent middle ground. Some experts say to have your oil changed whenever you take your car in for a tire rotation. That gives you a chance to kill two birds with one stone while having peace of mind that you're giving your car's engine the lifeblood it needs to be its best.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Maintenance"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-05-12T13:56:22.100Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6WKjIwCj8yCkj4coiA5Nrw/35c4079636bbec44b2a38bdb193606d9/pink-slip-for-car-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2aZ2DfLTe5J69r4UVm8hz6/ffc685a2d1823f980eb9a79749e8aa5d/pink-slip-for-car-325-image.jpg","slug":"pink-slip-for-car","title":"What is a Pink Slip for a Car?","publication_date":"2019-05-08T09:43-08:00","content_summary":"Learn all the ins and outs of transferring title to a vehicle from one party to another — including why the title is often called a \"pink slip.\"","parent_page":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides","slug":"guides"},"categories":[{"name":"Buying Guides","description":"Guides that help buyers with their automotive purchase.","parentCategory":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides"}}],"category":{"name":"Buying Guides","description":"Guides that help buyers with their automotive purchase.","parentCategory":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides"}},"author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"body":"### Your Car's Pink Slip — Or the Title to Your Car\n\nYour car's pink slip — more officially known as your certificate of title — is the legal document that establishes that you own your vehicle. Your state's Department of Motor Vehicles issues the car title to the vehicle's legal owner. When the ownership of the vehicle is transferred from one owner to another — as when you sell your car to someone else or when you make the final payment on your vehicle — a new certificate of title, or pink slip, must be issued to document the change of ownership.\n\n### Why Is It Called a \"Pink Slip\"?\n\nUntil 1988, California certificates of title were called \"pink slips\" because they were printed on pink paper. That was a handy mnemonic since the title slips otherwise looked identical to the annual car registration documents — Knowing the title was printed on pink paper kept owners from tossing the car title away as if it were an outdated vehicle registration. \n\nBecause the state of California has traditionally been home to more cars than any other state (with nearly twice as many as Texas, which is next in line), the popular slang term became widely known. The phrase \"pink slip\" also spread through the movies — In the 1950s, a whole string of movies depicted illegal street races in which the winner won the pink slip of the loser's car, referring to this as \"racing for pinks\" or \"racing for pink slips.\" Eventually, the phrase stuck as a common way to refer to a car's title.\n\n### What Information Does a Pink Slip Include?\n\nEach state has its own requirements regarding what must be included on the vehicle title, but there's a great deal of overlap. Typically you can expect your certificate of title to state:\n\n- The name of the car's legal owner; if there's a car loan on the vehicle, this should include the lienholder or lender\n- The car's registered owner, who is usually the person using the vehicle (if there's no loan on the vehicle, the car's registered owner and legal owner are typically the same)\n- The vehicle identification number\n- The car's make, model, and year of manufacture\n- The car's license plate number\n- The car's purchase price, its weight, and other tax-related information\n- The car's mileage at the time of sale\n\n### How Do You Transfer a Vehicle's Title to a New Owner?\n\nBoth the seller and buyer are involved in any transfer of a car's title — the seller signs the pink slip to release ownership and transfer it to the new owner. Typically there's a place on the back of the certificate designed for the transfer of title. Often the back of the pink slip also contains directions for transferring title. The new owner also has to sign the back of the pink slip to make the transfer official.\n\nIn some states, you may have to have the signed pink slip notarized. Other states require a bill of sale or additional paperwork to finalize the transfer of title.\n\nIf you're buying a new car or a used car from a car dealer, the dealer typically takes care of all this paperwork. You take possession of your new car once you've paid for it (or made payment arrangements by arranging for a car loan), at which time you get a temporary certificate of title. Your state's DMV then mails you the vehicle title.\n\nIf you're selling your car to a private party (or buying a car from a private party), you need to transfer the title yourself.\n\n### What's the Buyer's Role in the Transfer of Title?\n\nAfter the seller has signed the certificate of title, the buyer delivers the signed pink slip to their state's Department of Motor Vehicles. The buyer must now re-register the vehicle in their name (or the name of the new owner, if buying the car for another person). As a buyer, depending on your state, you may have to complete a separate transfer of ownership form. You can do this in person at the DMV, or you may be able to handle much of the process online. In some cases, a branch of the American Automobile Association can facilitate some of the paperwork.\n\nThe DMV then begins the process for issuing a new certificate of title. First, you'll receive temporary registration, and the new certificate of title, bearing the name of the new owner, will be sent by mail.\n\n### What Do You Do If More Than One Person Is Listed on the Vehicle Title?\n\nTake a look at your vehicle title before you get ready to transfer ownership. If your name is the only one on the title, you're the sole owner of the car. In this case, the transfer of ownership is simple and straightforward.\n\nYou may jointly own your car with someone else, perhaps your spouse, parent, or child. Now you have to take a closer look at how the names are written. If your name is connected to the other owner's name with the word \"or,\" either of you can sign the car title to transfer ownership. However, if the word \"and\" connects your names, both of you must sign the title for the transfer to be legitimate.\n\nIf you have a car loan on your vehicle, the lienholder (the bank, credit union or another lender) will be listed on the title. In this case, you have to pay off the auto loan (or transfer it to the new owner, if possible) before you can sell the car and transfer the title. In this case, give your lender a call and ask for their help in handling the transaction. They can tell you what requirements they have before you transfer ownership.\n\n### What If You Can't Find Your Pink Slip?\n\nIf you've lost your pink slip or it's been permanently damaged somehow, you need to replace it before you transfer ownership of your vehicle. Without your certificate of title, you have no tangible proof of ownership. \n\nEach state mandates a different process for getting a duplicate title certificate. You may need to go to the Department of Motor Vehicles, provide details about the car, do some paperwork, and pay a fee for a new pink slip. It's possible you may be able to apply for a duplicate title online or even by phone.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Licensing"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-05-10T00:09:38.005Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5U8OxLdnibhLrGxye38TBZ/000e632835984a7ecf59f86c057e0772/register-car-florida-image-1166.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/22QJKxakDMpv9iOgmCPEVS/a5009e68706f5c983d9c797a8f981bd2/register-car-florida-image-325.jpg","slug":"register-car-in-florida","title":"How to Register a Car in Florida","publication_date":"2019-05-07T09:13-08:00","content_summary":"Find out how to register a car in Florida whether you are a resident, non-resident or military service member residing or stationed in Florida.","parent_page":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides","slug":"guides"},"categories":[{"name":"Buying Guides","description":"Guides that help buyers with their automotive purchase.","parentCategory":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides"}}],"category":{"name":"Buying Guides","description":"Guides that help buyers with their automotive purchase.","parentCategory":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides"}},"author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"body":"If you've just moved to the state of Florida, you're probably wondering how to register a car there. When you move and intend to become a resident, you have 30 days to register your out-of-state vehicle with the Florida DMV. To do that, you need to fill a few requirements of becoming a resident.\n\n### What is Considered Florida Residency?\n\nIf you enroll your child in Florida public schools, if you are officially employed in Florida, or if you have a Florida living address through rental, lease or purchase, then you are considered a Florida resident. You are not considered a Florida resident if you've simply come to visit, even if you stay for several weeks.\n\n### What Documents Are Needed to Register a Motor Vehicle in Florida?\n\nAs with any other state, you'll need to bring all of your previous documents to the DMV. That will include your Florida license, vehicle registration, proof of car insurance, current license plate and certificate of title. Using these documents, the DMV will transfer your out of state car to Florida.\n\n### Vehicle Identification Number in Florida\n\nTo complete a Florida vehicle transfer, you will need to have your VIN physically inspected by either a law enforcement officer or a licensed car dealer in the state of Florida. If you have it verified by an out of state dealer, then you will need to have the verification confirmed via letterhead stationery from the dealer. \n\n### Full List of Parties Who Can Inspect Your Vehicle Identification Number\n\nYou can expedite the car registration process by completing a VIN inspection in advance. The following are some parties who are legally allowed to verify your VIN:\n\n- County tax collector's office\n- Any police officer\n- Any licensed Florida car dealership\n- Previous state's car dealer with dealership letterhead\n- Florida DMV inspectors\n- Florida Notary Public\n- An active duty military officer\n\n### Step By Step Vehicle Registration in Florida\n\n- __Step 1__ - Visit a Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles office (DHSMV)\n- __Step 2__ - Have your title and ID with you and show proof of Florida insurance.\n- __Step 3__ - If you haven't done it yet, have a VIN inspection and odometer reading done on site.\n- __Step 4__ - Pay the initial vehicle registration fee of $225, plus taxes, plate and title fees.\n\n### Additional Steps for Out of State Vehicles\n\nBefore you can register your vehicle with the steps indicated previously, you will need to obtain a Florida driver's license and buy Florida auto insurance from an insurance company. If you don't physically have your out of state title due to it being held by a lienholder, then you will have to contact the tax collector's office to have the lienholder send the title.\n\n### Vehicle Sales Tax for New Residents\n\nYou may be charged sales tax, use tax or discretionary local taxes on your vehicle by the state of Florida when you first register it. Whether these taxes are assessed or not depends on the length of time that you have owned your vehicle. If you've owned it for less than six months, then you can expect to be responsible for a six percent state sales or use tax and any required local taxes. The Florida tax will be pro-rated based on your previous state's taxes. For example, if you already paid four percent tax in your home state, then you will owe two percent tax for Florida.\n\nIf you've owned your vehicle for over six months, then you won't have to pay any of the above taxes. However, your vehicle documents will need to verify to the Florida DHSMV that you have owned your vehicle for over six months.\n\n### Car Dealer Registration\n\nIf you buy a car in Florida from a car dealership, you can get a temporary license plate and they will file the registration on your behalf. The dealer must transfer the title and registration within 30 days. You will also need to complete a bill of sale with the seller to have proof of the transaction. That action is essential to have in case the dealer does not transfer the title within the indicated time. At that point, you will have to visit the county tax collector's office to complete the process.\n\n### Buying a Vehicle in Florida as a Non-Resident\n\nIf you come to Florida and buy a new car or used car, but you are not a resident, then you will likely have to get temporary registration tags. Do this by visiting the county tax collector's office and showing proof of insurance. You also need to pay Florida sales tax on the vehicle. These tags allow you to drive it back to your home state.\n\n### Florida Military Vehicle Registration\n\nIf you're a military resident, then you follow the same steps as a Florida resident to register your vehicle. The main difference is that you won't have to pay the initial registration fee. To be exempt, you will have to fill out a Military Initial Registration Fee Exemption Affidavit.\n\nIf you are a non-resident military member who is only stationed in Florida, then you do not have to register your car in Florida. Maintain current registration in your home state and always carry proper proof of insurance. If you do want to register your vehicle in Florida, then you will have to complete the steps listed above and file the exemption to avoid the fee.\n\nSimilarly, if you are a Florida resident stationed out of state, you can continue to maintain your current Florida registration. To do this, you'll need the following items:\n\n- Original title or application for a certificate of title with/without registration\n- Florida insurance affidavit\n- Military insurance exemption\n- Military initial registration fee exemption\n- Exemption from Florida sales tax for military service members\n- Florida License Plates\n\nOnce you have filled out all registration forms and submitted them, you will get your new Florida license plates. The registration sticker should be placed in the upper right corner of the plate in the indicated square. You can choose to have standard Florida plates or personalized plates.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Licensing","States"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-05-24T23:46:35.196Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3u9EBgSRNbctuEyijzDz4K/45c6d70969e0a64c267ea018385c7754/selling-salvaged-cars-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5tEKYmXMrVb8YaNBOPd18e/1552796cf565f203bf65a487d96b9c88/selling-salvaged-cars-325-image.jpg","slug":"selling-salvaged-cars","title":"Selling Salvaged Cars Guide","publication_date":"2019-05-06T09:57+03:00","content_summary":"Selling salvage cars is tricky if you don't know the rules.

Salvaged vehicles are vehicles that insurance companies deem too expensive to replace or repair, whether because they've been stolen, vandalized, or damaged by bad weather or accidents. Even though such cars can't be driven with their salvage titles attached, there are many ways to get a salvage title car off your hands in exchange for money.\n\n### What Selling Salvaged Cars Entails and How It Works\n\nSalvage title laws vary by state, but the general principle is the same: Once an insurance company determines that a car's total damage exceeds a significant portion of its value — typically 75 to 90 percent — it labels the vehicle a total loss, and the department of motor vehicles (DMV) for the state slaps  a salvage title onto the vehicle. \n\nYou can't drive a salvage car unless you get a new title for it, and acquiring insurance for such a vehicle is very difficult. Even if you manage to do so, the insurance rates are probably not worth it. Most dealers don't accept salvage cars as trade-ins, even after the salvage title has been removed. Salvage titles sometimes come with special designations for their type of damage, such as hail or flood damage. Cars can also receive a non-repairable designation, which means they're incapable of being repaired and must instead be destroyed or sold for parts. If your wrecked car has successfully been fixed, however, and if it's passed your DMV's safety inspections, it can receive a new title with branding to show it's still roadworthy.\n\nIf the car was stolen and had been missing for a month or so, the insurance company may pay off the vehicle and sell it to a salvage buyer, in which case the car may receive a salvage title. Selling a salvage car to an insurance company is one of the quickest ways to make money off it — but not the most lucrative. Typically, the insurance company's settlement is low, so the company can profit from reselling the vehicle to the salvage buyer. As a result, you're better off selling to the end consumer directly. \n\nNewer salvage vehicles tend to sell better than old ones because the drivetrain components are more valuable. Many people also pay extra for niche salvage cars, such as Volkswagen Beetles or Porsches, since they may have a high repair or resale value and lots of rare parts. By contrast, junkers — that is, cars that have been around for more than a few decades — don't have much value. Once you've gone to your local DMV and received a salvage certificate for your car, you can sell the vehicle to a dealership willing to buy salvage vehicles, or you can look for other potential buyers.\n\n### Selling to a Salvage Yard\n\nSalvage yards love to buy salvage title cars, as they can scrap these cars for parts and crush them into metal blocks for recycling. If you want to sell your salvage car to a salvage yard, you need to collect your car's title and registration to show the buyer your vehicle is legitimate. \n\nDepending on the yard, you may also need a value appraisal of the car from Kelley Blue Book or the National Automobile Dealers Association, plus a detailed explanation of the car's damage. U-Pull-It salvage yards are a good option if you want to sell your salvage car without going through a go-between. These buyers purchase used cars from people, drain and dismantle them, and then park them together in large yards, where customers can manually collect their parts for a discounted rate. One benefit of U-Pull-It salvage yards is that they care mainly about the weight of the vehicle, so you're not as likely to be penalized if you have an older car. This method is especially lucrative when the metal market is doing well. Unfortunately, U-Pull-It yards don't pay as much for rare or luxury cars, since they only sell parts.\n\nAnother option is to sell your salvage title to a full-service salvage yard. In addition to draining and dismantling salvage title cars, full-service yards remove the parts from vehicles themselves. They also clean the parts and give them warranties. If you have a newer or more valuable salvage car, you can earn more by selling it to a full-salvage yard than a U-Pull-It yard, because the full-salvage yard pays extra for high-value parts, which they, in turn, sell to body shops and dealerships. If you have a niche car, try to find a salvage yard specializing in such vehicles, as it might pay you more for your vehicle than a regular yard.\n\n### Other Ways to Sell Your Car\n\nIf you don't want to sell your salvage title to a salvage yard, there are plenty of alternatives. For example, you can find a private car buyer who's happy to pay you a significant fraction of the car's value, either because they can use the car's parts or because they want the vehicle as a collector's item. Alternatively, you can find a dealer willing to take salvage cars as trade-ins, or you can call a hauler or tow company to buy the car for cheap, and they can sell it to a salvage yard for a profit. \n\nCalling a tow company is a good idea if you don't want to transport your salvage car to a yard and can't find a yard that's willing to pick up the vehicle for you. You can also donate your vehicle to a charity, such as Make-A-Wish or Kars4Kids, for a tax deduction. Another way to get a salvage car off your hands is to bring it to a salvage vehicle auction, where recyclers can bid on your vehicle. To auction off your salvage car, however, you may have to pay auction fees of $250 to $600 (as of 2019) and file some paperwork. You may also need to tow your vehicle to the auction, which can be expensive. \n\nKeep in mind that you don't have to sell your salvage car whole. You can always dismantle the vehicle yourself and sell the parts individually. This method takes time and requires some experience, but it might get more money overall. Finally, you can try to rebrand your car. This method entails fixing the salvage car so it can receive a clean title as \"rebuilt\" or \"reconditioned.\" For this approach, you need to fix the vehicle or hire a mechanic to do so, taking care to photograph the car throughout the repair process. You can then give the DMV your photos, your bill of sale for the vehicle and your car's salvage title and request a vehicle inspection. If the DMV decides the car is roadworthy after inspecting it, the inspector can give the vehicle a decal authorizing it as such. You can then file for a new title with the DMV. Although this process is expensive, car buyers are apt to pay you more for a rebuilt salvage car. Just make sure you follow state-specific laws when rebranding.\n\nSelling salvaged cars can be a challenge. You may find it hard to determine the true worth of your salvage car, as most car appraisal sites don't evaluate salvage titles. If you pick the right buyer, though, you can turn your car into a nice chunk of change even if it's been totaled. Offer the vehicle to a salvage yard, or sell the vehicle another way, such as by auctioning it off or scrapping it for parts.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Car Selling"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-05-06T23:52:00.025Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/wIzU18APKvyvvzvXv42Ba/1e47e348df5cf34a848adb43bf540278/can-you-sell-a-car-without-a-title-image-1166.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2bGRBAdYzKTlIoAF8TKUVh/42c368cee3a02c942145ebf6ef81f472/can-you-sell-a-car-without-a-title-image-325.jpg","slug":"sell-car-without-title","title":"How Can You Sell a Car Without a Title?","publication_date":"2019-05-03T09:51-08:00","content_summary":"Learn how to sell a car without a title and how to obtain a title when you need one.

Not having a certificate of title doesn't mean you're stuck with your used car, though. Learning how to sell a vehicle without a title is easier than you might think.   \n\n### What is a Car Title and Why is it Necessary?\n\nJust as the deed to a house is the legal document that proves ownership of the house, a car title is a document that shows legal ownership of a car. Some states call the record a title, certificate of title, or pink slip because they used to be printed on pink paper. A state’s motor vehicles department issues titles to a vehicle's owner and sellers transfer their certificates of title to whoever buys their cars.  \n\nGenerally, new car owners need car titles for the vehicles they purchase, and if you're selling a used car, you're the one to give it to the new owner. Giving your purchaser the title proves you're the true owner of the car, it's not stolen, and you have the right to sell it because there are no unsatisfied liens recorded on the title document. Buyers in most states need a certificate of title to complete the title transfer from the seller's name to their own, which establishes their full ownership rights.\n\n### Understanding the Different Types of Titles\n\nAs is true for deeds to houses, such as warranty deeds and quitclaim deeds, there are several types of car titles. A brand new car or a used car that has never been in a severe accident has a \"clean\" title. When a vehicle is damaged so badly in an accident that the insurance company calls it a total loss, or totals it, its title becomes a \"salvage\" title, because it's considered not worth repairing. Sometimes individuals decide to rebuild a totaled vehicle, and when that happens, the car is issued a “reconstructed” or \"rebuilt\" title before it can be sold. These title designations make potential new buyers aware that the car was previously in a condition so bad that it could not be driven, and significant repairs have been done to restore it. \n\nIf you purchased an untitled car and now wonder how to sell a vehicle without a title, consider obtaining a \"bonded\" title. A \"bonded\" title is a regular title, but it lets buyers know the title comes with a lost title bond. This surety bond protects you and previous owners of the car if a question arises about ownership and title transfers. If three to five years go by without title problems, the car owner can apply for a clean title. Before committing to pay a company for a lost title bond, check with your local DMV about whether you qualify for a bonded title. Some companies that offer lost title bonds provide free instant quotes, so shop around.\n\nExpect to need a title if a private party plans to buy your used Subaru, Ford, or Lexus, or if you're trading it in for a new car from a licensed dealer. However, you might not need a title if you're getting rid of a junk car. For some junk car buyers, your driver's license and valid registration are enough to seal a cash deal. Car junker requirements vary, so do some research if you want to make a junk car sale without a title. If you prefer to be on the safe side, take advantage of simple ways to obtain a certificate of title for your vehicle when you don't have the title in hand.\n\n### How the DMV Can Help You Sell a Car With No Title\n\nEvery state's DMV has a method of helping car owners who have lost titles or need duplicate titles. To get a duplicate title in Missouri, just complete Form 108, Application for Missouri Title and License, include your payment and mail them to the state's DMV. After two weeks, use the DMV online inquiry form to follow up on your application's status. \n\nNew York replaces certificates of title by mail when the owner of the vehicle places an order for a replacement title online, applies at a local DMV office, or submits an application by mail. No matter how you apply, New York's Department of Motor Vehicles mails the new title to the address the owner of the vehicle has on file at the application time. New York's DMV sends replacement vehicle titles within three business days of receiving orders but offers express mail service for an additional fee. With the replacement title in hand, you no longer face the dilemma of how to sell a car without a title. \n\nCalifornia provides duplicate titles, paperless title certifications, and title transfers with duplicate or paperless titles. Apply by mail or in person at your local DMV. If you go to the Department of Motor Vehicles office, make an appointment first to avoid a long wait time, and take your California photo driver license or identification card with you.\n\n### Selling a Car Without a Title When There's a Car Loan \n\nWhether you purchased a new car or a used car, if you took out a car loan for it, you have a bill of sale, but the lender may have the title. Typically, lenders hold car titles until the owners of the vehicles pay the loans in full. If you're ready to sell in this situation, work with your lender or lienholder to calculate the payoff amount. Once you know how much you need to pay the debt and make a profit, reach an agreement on the sale price with your potential new owner. When you make the payoff with the buyer's cash, the lender releases the vehicle title to you, and you deliver it to the new owner. \n\n### How to Sell a Car When No Title Was Issued\n\nSome states don't issue car titles for cars over a certain age. New York doesn't require titles for vehicles from 1972 and older, and Connecticut doesn't require vehicle titles for model years more than 20 years older than the current year. The last owner's registration, a Supplemental Assignment of Ownership Form Q-1, and/or Bill of Sale Form H-31 are all a buyer needs to register a non-titled car in Connecticut. A handwritten bill of sale is acceptable as long as it describes the vehicle, states the sale price, date sold, and contact information for the buyer and seller. \n\nGoing the bill of sale route is likely to work for states that don't issue or require titles. Make sure your bill of sale includes details about the car you're selling. State the car's make, model, year, vehicle identification number (VIN) and any distinguishing features, such as a custom paint job or special accessories. The sale price, date, buyer's and seller's signatures, and contact information, including phone numbers and email addresses, are essentials. Notarizing the bill of sale document adds an extra level of legal protection. Depending on the state's requirements, a buyer or seller might need to complete other paperwork for the new owner to receive a title.\n\nKnowing how to sell a car without a title and how to obtain a title when it's necessary gives you an advantage when you're ready to make a deal. Whether you're negotiating a used car sale or a trade-in of your vehicle for a new one, you have peace of mind because the proof of ownership you and the buyer need for a smooth transaction is in your hands.

The term Positraction describes the mechanism that provides drivers with more traction control of their cars than they get with an open differential. People say Positraction when they talk about limited slip differentials generally. Think of it as saying Kleenex when you mean tissues or Xerox when you mean making copies.\n\n### What is a Differential?\n\nA differential is a device within your vehicle's axle assembly. Differentials do three things: deliver power to each axle shaft or wheel, let the outside wheel spin faster or slower than the inside wheel, and serve as the last gear reduction drive system for the drivetrain. Variable wheel spins are essential when driving. When you're turning a corner, your car's outside wheel needs to travel further than the inside wheel, so the outer wheel needs to rotate faster than the inside wheel. The differential makes the variation possible. Automakers install different kinds of differentials on their vehicles, depending on the vehicle type.\n\n### Open Differentials \n\nMost passenger cars have open differentials on their rear axles. Sometimes called a standard or conventional differential, this mechanism features two side gears in the differential carrier, with each gear splinted to accommodate an axle shaft. Gears inside the case, called spider gears, on a shaft in the case, transmit power. A ring gear bolted to the differential carrier drives the case. \n\nThe spider gears enable the wheels to spin at independent speeds, so drivers can turn and maneuver safely. If you hit a patch of loose gravel while driving an open differential car, the differential delivers more power to the wheel experiencing the least resistance. You get wheel spin on the loose surface side, but the side in contact with solid ground hardly moves, which keeps the vehicle under control. \n\nAn open or conventional differential system works well for paved roads and highway driving and helps tires wear evenly. However, this differential can cause problems for off-road, snow, or slippery-surface driving. Open differentials direct all the power to the wheel with less traction when one wheel has much more traction than the other. This total power transfer can cause the wheel with less traction to slip and spin.  \n\n### Limited Slip Differentials   \n\nLimited-slip differentials (LSDs) don't work like open differentials. A limited-slip differential senses when a wheel is spinning, so it sends more power automatically to the wheel with less traction, but it doesn't send all the power to that wheel. If all the power goes to one wheel, the driven wheel can lose traction, and the other wheel won't drive. Because a limited-slip differential prevents sending too much power to one wheel, it keeps both wheels powered, rotating, and maintaining traction, even in off-road, uneven, and slippery environments. \n\n### Why Limited-Slip Differentials Are Different\n\nWhen Ferdinand Porsche designed a Grand Prix racing car in 1932, the vehicle experienced excessive wheel spin at speeds up to 100 miles per hour. To solve the problem, Porsche hired the engineering firm ZF to develop a limited-slip differential. Today's automakers minimize tire slippage by producing limited slip differentials in several types of designs, using friction plates and cones or gears. Unlike conventional differentials, limited-slip differentials feature two power paths between the differential case and the axle shafts. Spider gears transmit some power to the side gears as in open differentials. Friction between the differential case, clutch plates, and side gears delivers the rest of the power to the wheels.\n\n### How Positraction Differentials are Designed\n\nPositraction differentials are designed with clutch plates that enable independent axle rotation when the vehicle is turning or when a wheel is slipping. Positraction units prevent loss of traction by sending power to both driven wheels. At the same time, each wheel rotates independently when necessary, preventing the non-slipping wheel from losing power. A slipping wheel loses power with the conventional rear end design. Positraction units benefit drivers on wet pavement and slick or icy roads, as well as racers launching off the starting line or taking a turn on a race track. The Positraction limited-slip differential design offers better vehicle handling and acceleration, and drivers get more forward power because the driven wheel slips less.  \n\n### The Popularity of Positraction Units\n\nGM has offered Positraction rear ends since 1957, and its 8.875-inch 12-bolt Positraction was most popular in Chevrolet passenger cars from 1965 to 1972. Pontiac offered a version of a Positraction unit, called Safe-T-Track, as an option on vehicles including the 1963 Pontiac Tempest. \n\nOwners of muscle cars in the 1960s and 70s took advantage of the benefits Positraction offered. Rear-wheel-drive automobiles, including Chevy and Ford model muscle cars, were equipped with a live axle, instead of independent rear tire suspension. When lots of torque is applied through the differential on a vehicle with a live axle, there is less traction on the right rear because the axle wants to turn with the torsion of the drive shaft. However, the axle is mounted to the vehicle frame, so it can't move. Cars without Positraction units would spin one wheel, but those with Positraction rear ends didn't have that problem. Some owners of muscle cars today are retrofitting their cars with equipment including the Duragrip Posi Differential. This equipment enables drivers to keep both wheels on the ground, achieve better traction, and avoid one-wheel burnouts.\n\n### How to Check for Positraction\n\nIf you're shopping for a car with an original Positraction rear end, look for a tag on the right lower cover bolt. There is a two- or three-digit axle code or a production date if the car has Positraction. If the rear end has an open differential, the tag is on the left lower cover-mounting bolt.  \n\nAnother way to check for Positraction is by jacking up the rear end, blocking the front wheels, and putting the car in neutral. Ask another person to hold one rear wheel while you try turning the other wheel. If you can turn the wheel on your side while the other wheel is held still, the rear differential is not a Positraction unit. If you cannot turn the wheel on your side while the other person is holding their wheel in place, then the axle is a Positraction. Original gear ratios for GM 10-bolt 8.5-inch Positraction differentials were 2.41:1, 2.56:1, 2.73:1, 3.08:1, 3.43:1, 3.73:1, and 4.10:1. \n\n### Locking Differentials\n\nAnother type of differential, called a locking differential, uses dog clutches instead of friction plates to send power to each wheel. A dog clutch transmits power by pressing the tooth of one side of the clutch to the tooth of the other clutch. Generally, this type of clutch is used in manual transmissions. When one wheel turns faster than the other, the differential disengages the appropriate clutch automatically and delivers power to the wheel that has greater traction. Instead of sending power in a smooth, progressive motion as with Positraction, the locking differential operates with a ratchet-like movement. \n\nSome differentials combine an open differential with a mechanical locking device drivers operate and lock manually. When drivers lock their devices, both axles turn at the same speed no matter what road conditions exist. To allow their vehicles to function with open differentials, drivers unlock the devices.\n\nThe development of Positraction decades ago enables drivers to operate their vehicles faster and safer. Driving on slick or icy roads, and off-road driving is more predictable for motorists due to the creativity of automotive engineers. However, whether you drive a vehicle with or without Positraction, you are always responsible for operating it safely","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Definitions"],"ctaText":"Browse Listing","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-05-02T21:18:54.073Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4YzuwWRLSE8jYCP1IDtZ7Q/244b59c40cac2d4c9e9a30c0f52735ee/negotiate-cpo-cars-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6DT6ko2iHkKAnrNDAE5hB8/c3d9567f764ec4e8987a34fc514db415/negotiate-cpo-cars-325-image.jpg","slug":"negotiate-certified-pre-owned-cars","title":"How Much Can You Negotiate on Certified Pre-Owned Cars?","publication_date":"2019-05-01T02:00-08:00","content_summary":"Learn the ins and outs of shopping for and negotiating for a certified pre-owned (CPO) car, including the importance of doing your research.","parent_page":{"name":"Certified Pre Owned (CPO)","description":"Certified Pre Owned (CPO)","slug":"cpo"},"categories":[{"name":"Buying Guides","description":"Guides that help buyers with their automotive purchase.","parentCategory":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides"}}],"category":{"name":"Buying Guides","description":"Guides that help buyers with their automotive purchase.","parentCategory":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides"}},"author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"body":"If you're not comfortable with the price premium you pay to buy a new car, but buying a used car makes you a bit nervous, there's good news. Right in the middle of those two options is the certified pre-owned vehicle. It's is a used car that's sold by a legitimate new car dealer right alongside all the manufacturer's new cars. \n\nA certified pre-owned car — sometimes shorthanded as a CPO car — is a used car, but it's the very best in the used car market. Certified pre-owned vehicles are typically late model cars, sometimes only a year or two old. Factory-trained mechanics have inspected it and often made any needed repairs. And the car comes with a dealer's warranty that covers a whole range of possible car repairs in the near future. Because the vehicle has gone through this very comprehensive inspection, you can feel peace of mind about its mechanical condition. \n\nBecause a CPO car is indeed a used car, you can expect to pay far less than you'd pay for a new car. However, CPO cars sit at the top of the used car price range typically. According to Kelley Blue Book, you can expect to pay an additional $1,400 per car on average for a CPO car, compared to what you'd pay for the same used car that hasn't been inspected and certified. So you may be wondering: Can you negotiate the price on a certified pre-owned vehicle? There's a fair amount you can negotiate. \n\nWhen you follow a smart process as you buy a CPO car, you'll be able to gather the information you need to be able to negotiate your deal, and you'll see just where the wiggle room might be. Take a look at how to buy a certified pre-owned car, including learning how to negotiate the price.\n\n### Check the Warranty\n\nNot all warranties are the same when it comes to certified pre-owned cars. Some dealers may offer you a warranty for a certain amount of time, say, three years. Others may offer a warranty that covers a certain number of miles. What these warranties cover may also vary. If you purchase a car that comes with only a powertrain warranty, you could be in for some big repair bills if your air conditioning goes out. Read the fine print carefully: You might be buying a bumper-to-bumper warranty, or you might not. If you aren't getting the warranty, you think you're getting, and you may need to purchase an extended warranty.\n\nAsk as well whether the warranty starts when you buy the car, or whether it started when the original buyer purchased the vehicle. If you're buying a late model car, the original factory warranty might still be in effect. Find out whether the original manufacturer's warranty overlaps the CPO warranty, or whether the CPO warranty picks up when the factory warranty ends. Make sure you know what's covered if you have multiple warranties on your new (used) car. In some cases, CPO warranties only cover the powertrain for 90 days — and that's not much of a warranty.\n\nThe warranty may be a place where you can do some negotiating. Is the dealer willing to increase the amount of time or number of miles covered, or can they provide you with an extended warranty of some kind? That's the kind of benefit that seems minimal now, but could be worth a lot in a few years.\n\n### Test Drive the Car\n\nAs with any used car, you should arrange for a test drive before you purchase a certified pre-owned vehicle. You want to do more than see how it feels to drive the car and whether you can see clearly in all directions. Check the mechanical operations of the vehicle. Do you hear any rattles? If you do, that could indicate that the vehicle has previously been in an accident. Also, listen for any noises when you turn on the air conditioning or the heat — these sounds can indicate the need for significant repairs.\n\nAs you steer, test to see if the car pulls to the right or left. If it does, there could be a problem with the alignment. See if the brakes feel mushy, and take the car out on the highway to check the acceleration as well as the braking. And of course, check all the electrical components (the stereo, speakers, phone charger, headlights, turn signals and tail lights). Also, take a look at the tires — if the tread is uneven, it could indicate issues with alignment or suspension.\n\nEven if you're not a trained mechanic, a look under the hood is a good idea. At the very least, you can see if the engine looks clean. Take a look at the transmission fluid to see if it's clear (if it's black, that's a problem). And take a good look at the exterior and interior of the car as well. Do you see scratches on the paint or maybe stains on the upholstery? Are there other signs that the car was previously owned and driven by someone who didn't take good care of it? The answers to these questions will help you determine just what you're comfortable paying for the car.\n\nOnce you've done your test drive, you now have learned valuable information to discuss with the car dealer. If you've found any problems, consider negotiating with the car dealer and asking to have them repaired at no charge.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Check the Details of the Certification\n\nIs the certified pre-owned car you're considering certified by the new car dealer or the manufacturer? Either can be the case. A manufacturer's certification is more valuable than a dealer's because it allowed you to take your used car to other dealers across the country for repairs and service — something that could be crucial if you end up moving out of your current area.\n\nThe certification should come with a checklist stating which components have been inspected and certified. Check to make sure nothing's been left off the list (especially if your test drive gave you any concerns). \n\nAlso, make sure that the used car you're considering actually is a CPO car. That distinction is especially important if you found it by strolling around a car dealership. Typically car dealers display cars from their CPO programs together, and it could be all too easy to wander away from the section of the dealership where they're kept.\n\n### Review the Inspection Reports and the Vehicle History Report\n\nYes, you want to drive the used car you're considering purchasing and check it out for yourself. But don't overlook the official inspection reports that are created as part of the certified car process. That report will tell you a lot about what you might have to pay for car maintenance in the near future. Are the brake pads about to wear out? Are there belts that will need replacing soon? The inspectors will look at parts of the car you can't see with a visual inspection, so it's essential to take their remarks into serious consideration.\n\nAlso, ask the car dealer for the vehicle history report. This report will let you know if the car has ever been in an accident so that you can check for frame damage. If the car dealer doesn't give you the vehicle history report, you should be able to order a copy of it from Carfax. Make sure you do order it. In some rare cases, unscrupulous car dealers don't inspect or recondition their used cars before declaring them CPO cars, but merely spray black paint on the engine to make it look new. If you run a vehicle history report and learn that the car's been in an accident — or worse, that it's been declared a salvage vehicle — walk away from the deal (which isn't really a deal at all).\n\nIf the car's history checks out, but you find some maintenance requirements coming due in the near future, ask the car dealer if they'd consider handling some of the maintenance right now — replacing the brake pads, for instance — as a way of getting a good deal on the car before you even try to negotiate the actual price.\n\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n\n### Research the Actual Value of the Car\n\nYou already know you can expect to pay a premium for a certified pre-owned car — but is that price worth it? You might find the same car — the same year, make and model — being sold as CPO vehicles at several car dealers. How do you know which is the better deal?\n\nNow it's time to do a little research. Kelley Blue Book and Edmunds both provide online car assessment and pricing tools, and they contain options for certified pre-owned cars, so you know you're comparing apples to apples. Fill out the checklists on these and similar sites to see if the price you're being quoted is realistic and fair. Once you have this information, check with other car dealers (and even private sellers, if you feel comfortable doing so) to see if you can find the same car for a better price.\n\nYou can also check sites like eBay to view completed auctions. That shows you not only the asking price for the car but also the final sale price. \nAsk the Car Dealer Some Tough Questions\n\nCan you return the CPO vehicle if it proves to be a lemon or to have significant problems? How much time do you have to make that return? If you do end up returning the vehicle, do you get a refund just on the purchase price? What about the license and registration fees? Will the dealer refund your sales tax?\n\n### Negotiate a Good Deal\n\nYes, you are allowed to negotiate when you're buying a certified pre-owned car. After all, you're paying a premium for that inspection and certification, so it just makes sense to try to negotiate the price down. This is where all the research you've done comes in. Have you discovered from Kelley Blue Book or Edmunds that the car is a bit overpriced? Did you find a vehicle on eBay or at another car dealer for a lower price? Now is the time to bring up that information and see how the car dealer you're negotiating with might respond.\n\nEven if the car dealer is offering you a reasonable price at market value, you can still make a lower offer. This is also when to look for other perks — a better extended warranty or some minor repairs, for instance. You may feel uncomfortable making a counteroffer, but rest assured that the car dealer expects it. And don't worry: the car dealer will still make a profit. Just keep focused on the peace of mind you'll feel once you know you achieved the best price possible for your pre-owned car.\n\nIf you're not paying cash for your CPO vehicle, or if you're not coming to the dealer with a car loan in place from, say, your credit union, you may also have some room to negotiate around your financing options. Certified pre-owned vehicles don't typically come with the zero-percent loans that new cars sometimes sport, but you may be able to arrange lower financing than your dealer initially offers.\n\n### Be Ready to Walk Away\n\nIf you know what a fair price is for the car you want, but the car dealer you're talking to refuses to meet it, walk away. No matter the make and model of the car you're interested in, you can be confident that there are many, many certified pre-owned versions of this car available. Remember, car buying services give you access to used vehicles from all over the country, so you aren't limited to what's available on one dealer's lot or even in your region. \n\nWhen you walk away, you might be surprised at how quickly the car dealer is suddenly willing to lower his asking price. And even if you just keep walking, don't worry — you'll find the right car at the right price very soon, thanks to all the resources available to you.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["CPO"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/cpo","modified_date":"2019-05-03T22:18:25.887Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3FN0BNMnxfEV5JyPHre459/fea3f0fb31e095f0aeef46317bf0867a/states-no-sales-tax-cars-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4YBKFzBjq3Emq0adRhdLA/7198bde61d1c949c3422934c7a534f05/states-no-sales-tax-cars-325-image.jpg","slug":"states-no-sales-tax-cars","title":"States with No Sales Tax on Cars","publication_date":"2019-04-30T10:03-08:00","content_summary":"Shop for your next car, truck or SUV in one of the states with no sales tax on cars and keep more money in your pocket or bank account automatically.

There are more than a handful of states with no sales tax on cars. If you live somewhere like New Mexico or New Hampshire and buy a car or SUV there, you won't have to pay any sales tax on it. If your state charges sales tax, a trip across a state line to a place that doesn't tax you for your purchase might be worthwhile.\n\n### What Is a Sales Tax?\n\nA sales tax is an amount of money state and local governments require sellers to collect when they sell goods or services. Sales taxes differ from excise taxes, which are flat-rate taxes you pay when you buy something such as motor vehicle fuel, or the materials to make a product. To compute state sales taxes on motor vehicles in most states, multiply the purchase price of the vehicle by the tax rate that applies. Typically, the more money a vehicle costs, the more sales tax a buyer pays. If a vehicle sales tax applies, the vehicle seller must collect the tax when the sale transaction occurs. Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon don't impose any state sales taxes, as of 2018, while New Mexico charges sales taxes, but not on cars. A tax rate of zero can equal a lot more cash staying in your pocket.\n\n### State and Local Sales Taxes Can Be Charged\n\nMany states that charge sales taxes at the state level also allow their local governments to impose sales and use taxes. The result is that you might pay more in taxes for the same vehicle at the same sales price, depending on the city or county of the state in which you buy the car. For example, in New York, the state sales tax rate is 4%, but county and local taxes can boost the rate up to 4.5% more. In other words, you might pay a tax rate between 4% and 8.5% for the same car at the same sales price. The good news for consumers is that New York limits its vehicle sales tax to a maximum of $725. A trip to Delaware or New Hampshire might mean no sales tax at purchase time.\n\n### States With No Sales Tax on Cars\n\nIf you don't live in or near New Hampshire, Delaware, Montana, Oregon, Alaska, or New Mexico, other states offer the opportunity to buy a vehicle without paying sales tax. Buy a car in Maryland, North Carolina, Iowa, or South Dakota, and you might be able to skip the cost of sales tax on your Ford, Chevy, or Subaru. Washington, D.C. doesn't charge sales tax on cars, either. However, some of these states charge use taxes, which serve the same purpose as sales taxes.\n\n### Florida Laws Benefit Buyers From States Without Sales Tax\n\nPeople who live in states that don't charge sales tax on used or new cars can use their home state's tax laws to their advantage in Florida. Under Florida law, out-of-state residents who buy used or new cars in the Sunshine State get a partial exemption of sales and use taxes. Florida only collects sales tax in the amount that purchasers would pay in their home states. This tax policy means residents of New Hampshire, Delaware, Montana, Oregon, Alaska, and New Mexico, who find and buy their dream cars in Florida don't pay sales or use taxes in Florida. \n\nWhen buying cars in Florida, Alabama residents pay only 2%, and Colorado residents pay 2.9%, their state's respective sales tax rates. Hawaii and Wyoming residents pay 4%, and Louisiana residents pay 5%. If you live in a state with a sales tax rate higher than Florida, such as New Jersey, California, and Tennessee, Florida gives you a partial exemption. The result? You pay a maximum of 6%, Florida's state sales tax rate, which saves money for you.  \n\n### No Florida Exemption for Certain States\n\nResidents of Arkansas, Mississippi, and West Virginia who buy cars in Florida must pay motor vehicle sales tax to their government because their states don't give credit for taxes paid to the state. Florida's state sales tax policies mean buyers get taxed twice for their motor vehicle purchases. These out-of-state residents end up paying tax in Florida at the sale and paying again in their home states when they license their vehicles at the DMV.\n\n### How to Claim the Florida Sales Tax Exemption\n\nNonresident buyers must apply for their exemption when the sale occurs. Whether the transaction is through a dealer or a private individual, the buyer must fill out and submit Form DR-123, Affidavit for Partial Exemption of Motor Vehicle Sold for Licensing in Another State. This form states the buyer's intent to license the purchased vehicle in their home state within 45 days of the purchase date. If the sale is through a dealer, the buyer gives the form to the dealer. In a private sale transaction, the buyer provides the exemption form to the private tag agent or tax collector when purchasing the vehicle's temporary tag. \n\n### Michigan's Sales Tax Exemptions Similar to Florida's\n\nAs a general rule, if you live out of state, buy a car in Michigan, and take delivery there, you must pay sales tax in Michigan. However, if you have the dealer or seller ship or deliver your car to a location outside the state, then no sales tax is due back to Michigan. For example, if you live in Illinois, Indiana, or Minnesota, buy a car in Michigan, and have the seller or dealer deliver it to your home state, you won't pay any sales tax in Michigan. But if you decide to drive the car home to Illinois, Indiana, or Minnesota, the dealer must charge you sales tax in Michigan.\n\nLike Florida, Michigan exempts out-of-state car buyers from sales tax when their home state has no sales tax on cars. So if you buy a Ford F-150, Chevy Tahoe, or Honda Civic in Michigan, but plan on titling and registering it in one of the sales tax-free states, – such as Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, Oregon, or New Mexico – the state of Michigan exempts your vehicle from its sales tax. \n\nMichigan also exempts residents of the District of Columbia and 10 non-reciprocal states from sales taxation. In the West, these states are Oklahoma, Arkansas, West Virginia, South Dakota, and Nebraska. In the East, they include North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, and Maryland. Because these states impose a use tax, which serves the same purpose as a sales tax, Michigan allows exemptions to protect purchasers from being taxed twice for a single sales transaction. \n\nBuying your new car is a significant event and is one of the most expensive and longest-term purchases many people make. Therefore, it's worth spending some extra time searching for ways to save some money – a lot of money, in some cases. If you live in or near one of the states with no sales tax on cars, take full advantage of your money-saving position. Do your research, find the vehicle you want, and make your best deal. Then, congratulate yourself on how much you saved by being in the right place at the right time.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"modified_date":"2019-05-02T21:18:36.168Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5oCw9Y54D9rLnIx1nAi38I/8933fd5fb316e8148fb7d93dcd475d21/what-is-car-title-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3LZMQsvGWUWofr0euOmtNH/f06a422960ce220a2d4d0e3624c9e163/what-is-car-title-325-image.jpg","slug":"what-is-car-title","title":"What is a Car Title?","publication_date":"2019-04-29T09:12-08:00","content_summary":"Before you buy or sell a vehicle, it's important that you understand how car titles work.

It also provides details about the history of the vehicle. A vehicle title may also be known as a certificate of title or a pink slip. If you plan on buying, selling, or registering a vehicle, it's essential that you understand the ins and outs of car titles. Read on for detailed information on car titles so you can be confident in whatever your next step may be.\n\n### Title Information\n\nThe information on your title varies depending on where you live. The following information is typically found on a state title:\n\nVehicle identification number: The vehicle identification number, or VIN, is a number that identifies the vehicle. If you're considering purchasing a new vehicle, it's essential that you check the VIN on the title to make sure that it matches the VIN on the car. The VIN can usually be found either on the driver's side of the car's dashboard near the windshield. If you don't see it there, check the bottom of the driver's side door pillar with the door open.\n\nOdometer reading: The title should also show what the car's mileage was at the time when the owner applied for the title. If the mileage says \"Not Actual,\" that means that the odometer disclosure may not be accurate. While it could be an honest mistake that occurred at some point along the vehicle's paper trail, you should be cautious, as the odometer may have been rolled back.\n\nOwner information: The car title should clearly state the name(s) and address(es) of the current owner and any other owners from the past. If you're going to become the new owner of the car, be sure to verify that information first, so you know you're buying the vehicle from the true legal owner.\n\nVehicle details: At very least, the title will state the car's make, model, and model year. It may also have other information such as the style of vehicle, the number of the license plates, the car's weight class, and how it runs (gas, diesel, electric, or hybrid).\n\nLender details: If the previous owner used financing to buy the car, the lender's name and address would be listed on the title. Until the loan is repaid, the lender is the legal owner of the vehicle. A lien release occurs after the lender has been paid.\n\n### Types of Car Titles\n\nNot all titles are the same. As long as the vehicle hasn't had any significant issues, you should receive a standard title known as a clean title. However, if the car has been damaged in some way (even if the damage has been repaired), it may have one of these titles:\n\n__Lemon law title:__ Some states have lemon laws\" that protect the buyer in case the vehicle turns out to be defective and can't be fixed within a certain amount of time after a certain amount of tries. If the car does turn out to be a lemon, the original seller will repurchase it. These buyback lemons can be resold, but the title must state that they were bought back because of past problems. Always be extremely cautious when buying a car with a lemon law title.\n\n__Salvage title:__ Cars that have been in major accidents that cause significant damage will have a salvage title. The salvage title means that the car can't be driven as it is, so it will need to be repaired or used for parts. Like lemon law titles, you should never buy a car with a salvage title unless you're confident that it's a smart decision. When it comes to shopping for used vehicles, deals that seem too good to be true usually come with a catch.\n\n__Rebuilt title:__ A car with a salvage title that has been repaired gets a rebuilt title. In other words, the vehicle used to be severely damaged, but now it's in driving condition. A rebuilt title doesn't necessarily mean that it's roadworthy, so be sure to have the vehicle thoroughly inspected by a trusted mechanic before you considering buying it.\n\n__Flood title:__ A car with a flood title has gone through water damage. While that may not seem like a big deal, a car with a flood title has sat in water that's deep enough to fill the engine compartment. Unfortunately, some vehicles that have had flood damage may be cleaned, \"repaired,\" and sold in a different state. That's why it's crucial that you check the vehicle's Carfax history before considering a transfer of ownership.\nTransferring Ownership of a Vehicle\n\nNow that you understand the information on a car title and the different types of car titles you may see, you may be wondering how titles factor into the buying or selling of a used vehicle. Fortunately, it's a reasonably straightforward process. Here's how to transfer the ownership of a vehicle:\n\nFirst, check the back of the title. You'll see the Title Assignment sections. The seller completes one, and the buyer completes the other. The instructions state the information that you'll need to include, which includes names addresses, and car details.\n\nAlthough filling out this information is easy, it's incredibly vital that you're extremely careful. If you make an error, you can't undo it. You'll have to provide a bill of sale and notarized documents to obtain a duplicate title, which is an easily avoidable pain that neither of you will want to deal with. One of the most common errors is that the buyer or seller will put their information in the wrong section, so triple-check where you're writing.\n\nFinally, it's vital that the seller keeps a photocopy of the car title for at least 18 months. That protects them if the new owner has a legal problem related to the car. For example, say the new owner never re-registered the vehicle and then crashed into a building. Now, because the vehicle is still technically in your name (even though you sold it), you're legally obligated to pay for the damage caused by \"your\" vehicle.\n\nIf this type of nightmare situation occurs and you don't have a copy of the title, a lawyer should be able to help you. However, nobody wants to deal with that kind of headache. Your copy of the transferred title protects you and makes it easy to clear up the situation.\n\n### Obtaining a New Title\n\nIt's important that you keep your car title in a safe location. However, sometimes accidents happen, and the title may become lost or destroyed. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to get a duplicate title. The process varies depending on where you live, but usually, you'll need to go to the department of motor vehicles with your driver's license, fill out and show the required paperwork, and pay a title fee.\n\n### Shop Smart\n\nIf you're shopping for a used or new car with a clean title, Autolist can help.

Some buyers want a safe vehicle, others wish for added performance for a specific purpose, and still, others want a new car with the latest technology. However, most people want reliable vehicles that they won't have to be taking to the shop continually. There's no doubt that some brands are more reliable than others. J.D. Power rates the most reliable vehicles using a one-to-five scale. Consumer Reports is another group that tracks the most reliable car brands. According to that publication, Toyota and Lexus are consistently among the most reliable car brands. \n\n### Here are other brands that have topped the rankings this year, or have made significant changes.\n\n__Chevrolet__\n\nUpon averaging the individual reliability scores of Chevy vehicles, the brand achieves an average of 3.5 out of five. That makes the Chevy brand above average for reliability. For example, the Corvette's reliability is about average, but the subcompact Sonic brings the rate up with a four out of five reliability score.\n\n__Honda__\n\nRanking slightly above Chevrolet with an average reliability score of 3.6, Honda is also listed at 15 in the Consumer Reports list of the most reliable car brands. According to that publication, the most reliable Honda model is the Fit. Bringing Honda's score down is the Odyssey minivan, which ranks only 2.5 out of five. On the higher end of the rankings is the Honda Ridgeline pickup, which ranks 4.5 and is considered one of the top trucks on the market.\n\n__BMW__\n\nJust a smidgen above Honda is BMW with an average reliability score of 3.7. BMW also sits at number 8 on the Consumer Reports list with its most reliable vehicle being the BMW i3. All of BMW's vehicles score above average. Among the highest ranked is the 4 Series and the X6 midsize SUV.\n\n__Kia__\n\nThe Korean automaker is well-known for its strong warranty with its basic one at five years or 60,000 miles and the powertrain at 10 years or 100,000 miles. The average reliability for Kia is 3.8, which puts it slightly above Honda. Consumer Reports puts Kia in at number five on its list with the Kia Sedona as the most reliable model. The Kia Soul is also a top-ranked vehicle, having earned the US News Best Compact Car for the Money award for the 2017 model year. One of the vehicles bringing Kia's score down is the Sedona, which J.D. Power ranks at 2.5 out of five.\n\n__Mercedes-Benz__\n\nMercedes gets an average reliability score of 3.9, but it is not in the Consumer Reports top-15 list. However, the automaker has a reliable cadre of vehicles with most of them scoring four out of five from J.D. Power. \n\n__Toyota__\n\nAlthough known for years as one of the most reliable car brands, Toyota only manages a 3.9 as an average score. However, it is listed on the Consumer Reports list at number two with the Prius being the most reliable vehicle. Regardless of this score, Toyota has long been associated with vehicle dependability and is often the brand buyers turn to when they want a reliable new car.\n\n__Buick__\n\nAlso sitting at 3.9 is Buick with several premium vehicles to choose. Buick is not on the Consumer Reports top fifteen top reliability list, however. Some of the highest ranking cars for Buick include the Cascada and the Enclave.\n\n__Lincoln__\n\nAlso competing in the luxury realm is Lincoln, and the American brand manages a solid 4.0 in average predicted reliability. None of the Lincoln vehicles fall below four in the J.D. Power rankings, but they tend to be outranked by higher performing competition.\n\n__Lexus__\n\nThe brand that consistently sits atop the Consumer Reports rankings with its top vehicle listed as the Lexus GX. It achieves a 4.5 average reliability score, and only a few vehicles drop below four out of five. Some of the higher ranked Lexus vehicles include the ES, RX and NX.\n\n__Porsche__\n\nAlso achieving a 4.5 out of five average reliability score, Porsche is on the Consumer Reports list as well at number 11. The most reliable model there is listed as the Porsche 911. Porsche only sells a small stable of vehicles with only six on the market for 2018. According to U.S. News, these vehicles sit in the top for cars in their respective markets. None of the Porsche vehicles scored lower than four.\n\n### Consumer Reports Top 15 for 2018\n\nEvery year, Consumer Reports releases a comprehensive list for the most reliable car brands and the vehicles within. It's a handy guide for car buyers who are looking for the most reliable brands. Lexus and Toyota have been at the top of the list for six straight years including 2018. Lexus was given an average reliability score of 78 out of 100 while Toyota got 76. Mazda jumped the highest in the reliability rankings to sit at third place. , and they also hold a total of 11 out of the top 15. There are no American brands in the top 15 of this list, and nine brands are among the 10 least reliable. The following is the full list of Consumer Reports top 15 most reliable brands with reliability scores out of 100:\n\n1. Lexus - 78\n2. Toyota - 76\n3. Mazda - 69\n4. Subaru - 65\n5. Kia - 61\n6. Infiniti - 61\n7. Audi - 60\n8. BMW - 58\n9. Mini - 57\n10. Hyundai - 57\n11. Porsche - 54\n12. Genesis - 52\n13. Acura - 51\n14. Nissan -51 \n15. Honda - 50\n\nIn the case of Nissan and Honda, the luxury brands from these companies score higher than their flagship brand. It's easy to see why Toyota and Lexus hold their reputation for being extremely reliable vehicles. There is almost a 10 point difference between second-place Toyota and third-place Mazda.\n\n### Ten Least Reliable Vehicles \n\nAccording to Consumer Reports, the following vehicle brands are the least reliable brands on the market:\n\n1. Lincoln\n2. Dodge\n3. Jeep\n4. Chevrolet\n5. Chrysler\n6. GMC\n7. Ram\n8. Tesla\n9. Cadillac\n10. Volvo\n\nWhen it comes to American automakers, Ford is the highest ranked by Consumer Reports, sitting at the 18th spot overall. \n\n### 2018 Most Reliable Vehicles\n\nIn addition to ranking the most reliable brands, Consumer Reports also has data on the most reliable individual vehicles, including these top ten:\n\n1. Lexus GX\n2. Toyota Prius C\n3. Toyota Prius Prime\n4. Mazda MX-5 Miata\n5. Toyota Corolla\n6. Lexus NX\n7. Toyota Prius\n8. Honda Fit\n9. Kia Sedona\n10. Toyota Highlander\n\nWith this list, it's easy to see why Toyota and Lexus dominate the top spots with so many reliable vehicles. Combined, the brands also take six out of 19 total categories from J.D. Power.\n\n### 2018 Least Reliable Vehicles\n\nAlong with the lowest ranked brands, Consumer Reports lists the least reliable vehicles as well. The ten worst cars include:\n\n1. Honda Odyssey\n2. Volkswagen Atlas\n3. Buick Enclave\n4. Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD\n5. Kia Cadenza\n6. Chevrolet Traverse\n7. Honda Clarity\n8. Cadillac ATS\n9. Tesla Model X\n10. Ram 3500\n\nIt's worth noting that J.D. Power ranks vehicles by category, so some of the vehicles that win categories there may still belong to the lowest rated brands in terms of overall reliability. For example, the Odyssey is the top performer in the minivan category there despite being ranked as one of Consumer Reports least reliable vehicles.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Reliability"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-04-30T18:11:26.952Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6lJKJ6Wvvj2yHd7p1quwzd/e895820a90722c6de56afca086418915/beater-car-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/47WUK2lG9M1ehbZIDpvEJz/2907363892bac7a567c978114bdb087a/beater-car-325-image.jpg","slug":"what-is-a-beater-car","title":"What is a Beater Car?","publication_date":"2019-04-25T10:33-08:00","content_summary":"Buying a beater car is a great way to save some money.

While there are plenty of reasons to prefer a brand new car, a solid beater can be an ideal option if you find the right one. Driving a beater may not feel as luxurious as driving a newer car, but the cheap price point lets you save money while still ensuring that you're able to get from point A to B.\n\n### What Is a Beater Car?\n\nA beater car is a vehicle that you run into the ground. They are typically older, high-mileage cars that still run well. They may not look pretty, but they do what they were made to do. A beater car may have cosmetic issues or minor malfunctions, but if you maintain them properly, they can provide years of service. On average, beaters cost around $500 to $2,000. \n\n### Beater Benefits\n\nSaving money is the most apparent reason to shop for a beater car. Whether you have limited funds available or you're just trying to be a bit more frugal, you can buy a reliable vehicle without breaking the bank. Beaters are great because you can typically pay for them up front in cash. If you don't want to have a monthly car payment to worry about, buying a beater car is the logical choice.\n\nBeyond improving your financial situation, driving a beater gives you peace of mind. Dents and dings are no big deal, and if the car has a problem that's not worth fixing, you can buy a new beater. While driving a nice car like a brand new Mercedes or Lexus may be enjoyable, you're probably going to be paranoid parking in a crowded lot.\n\nAnother beater car advantage is that you're able to get the minimum required insurance coverage, saving you even more money. If your car costs more than $5,000, you're going to need full coverage vehicle insurance, which can cost as much as three times more than minimum coverage. Driving a beater can save you thousands of dollars in car insurance expenses.\n\nBeaters have also already gone through their depreciation phase. They say that a car loses 20 to 30 percent of its value as soon as you drive it off the lot. Older cars have already diminished in value over the years, so they're not going to lose much value during your ownership period. You may even be able to resell your beater for close to what you paid for it.\n\nCompared to a newer car, an old car will typically use cheaper gas. Many modern vehicles require premium gas, and the cost of filling your tank can add up over time. Driving an old beater lets you reduce fuel costs, and that means more money in your pocket. In addition to cheaper gas, beaters typically have cheaper parts. Cars from the 1990s and 2000s have parts that are generally readily available, so if your check engine light comes on, you shouldn't have to worry about a massive bill from your mechanic.\n\nFinally, if you live in an area that requires you to pay vehicle taxes, you're going to save money by driving a car with a lower resale value. Again, beaters are just cheaper to own. It's not just the lower initial buying price that saves you cash — owning a new car is expensive, even after you've paid it off. Cheap cars keep your bills down.\n\n### Choosing the Right Beater\n\nNot all beaters are equal. A beater can save you a whole lot of money, but it can also cost you a whole lot of money if you're not careful. First, check the mileage. A car that has been well-maintained can last as long as 200,000 miles (or even more). If the vehicle in question has 200,000 miles on it, you should only expect it to last for 50,000 miles or so, if you're lucky.\n\nYou'll also want to research the vehicle's ownership history. The best beater cars have only had one owner. The reason why you want fewer owners is that if the vehicle has had multiple owners, there's a good chance that one or more of the owners didn't maintain it properly. A vehicle that has been well-loved by one person is much less likely to run into issues in the future.\n\nAs you shop for a beater, be sure to compare the seller's asking price with the Kelley Blue Book value. If the asking price is significantly lower, make sure you find out why. While you might just be getting a great deal, usually if a price seems too good to be true, there's a reason. \n\nAlthough it's not always possible, buying beaters from friends, family members, or even friends of friends is ideal. If you get a bad feeling from the seller, it's probably best to move along. Trust your instincts, and try to find a great deal from a seller who seems trustworthy. Ask why they're selling the vehicle. For example, if they're moving overseas or if they just purchased a brand new car, it makes sense that they would want to get rid of their beater. However, if they don't have a solid reason why they're selling the car, that's a red flag.\n\nBefore you buy a beater, be sure to have it checked out by a trusted mechanic. Even if the vehicle in question seems like a good car on paper and on the road, there's always a chance that there's a potential problem under the hood. \n\nFinally, make sure you research the car's year, make, and model. Some vehicles are well-known for their dependability, while others may be notorious for being lemons. Spend some time reading about the vehicles on online forums. If you know any car enthusiasts, ask for their opinion. \n\nHere are some of the best beater cars that have earned a solid reputation over the years:\n\n- [Honda Civic](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic-under+2000)\n- [Toyota Corolla](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-corolla-under+2000)\n- [Toyota Camry](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-camry-under+2000)\n- [Honda Accord](https://www.autolist.com/honda-accord-under+2000)\n- [Nissan Altima](https://www.autolist.com/nissan-altima-under+2000)\n- [Subaru Outback](https://www.autolist.com/subaru-outback-under+2000)\n- [Jeep Cherokee](https://www.autolist.com/jeep-cherokee-under+2000)\n- [Buick LeSabre](https://www.autolist.com/buick-lesabre-under+2000)\n- [Honda Odyssey](https://www.autolist.com/honda-odyssey-under+2000)\n- [Ford Escort](https://www.autolist.com/ford-escort-under+2000)\n- [Chevy Cavalier](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-cavalier-under+2000)\n\n### Shop Smart\n\nThe key to finding an awesome deal on a beater car is to spend some time shopping around. As long as you don't need a vehicle immediately, time is your friend. Check local classified ads and put the word out on social media that you're on the hunt for a beater. \n\nAutolist makes finding the perfect beater a breeze. You can browse multiple new and used vehicle websites and select cars that fit your preferred price point. Autolist lets you view a tremendous amount of listings with detailed information including the vehicle's Carfax report. Autolist's selection of used cars is more substantial than Craigslist and Cargurus, giving you fast and easy access to the best deals in the country.\n\nBuying a beater can be a gamble, but you can drastically tip the odds in your favor by casting a wide net. As long as you proceed with caution, you can find a dependable vehicle for very little money. Do your homework, and stick with cars that have withstood the test of time. You may not end up with the prettiest ride, but you'll be able to get where you need to go on the cheap.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Affordable"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/under+2000","modified_date":"2019-04-30T18:13:36.537Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1d8g93FMrg8jVIaxO5GYVq/2582d22ff6bb83104eed169244861cf0/10-things-buying-car-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/U99hlxokQVSRmVj7OUhwV/07849cff716c235c3cfc9a3834d96032/10-things-buying-car-325-image.jpg","slug":"things-to-know-before-buying-car","title":"10 Things To Know Before Buying a Car","publication_date":"2019-04-24T08:54-08:00","content_summary":"Discover 10 things you need to know about buying a car so you can get a great deal on a vehicle that meets your needs and fits your budget.","parent_page":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides","slug":"guides"},"categories":[{"name":"Buying Guides","description":"Guides that help buyers with their automotive purchase.","parentCategory":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides"}}],"category":{"name":"Buying Guides","description":"Guides that help buyers with their automotive purchase.","parentCategory":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides"}},"author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"body":"Car buying can be a stressful experience, but there are things you can do to make the process go more smoothly. Before you even step foot on the dealer's lot or take a vehicle out for a test drive, consider doing some research to arm yourself with the important information you need to be a smart shopper. \n\n### Here are 10 things to know before buying a car.\n\n__1. Check Out Your Credit Report__\nBuying a car is a big purchase, so financing should be at the top of your to-do list before you even start looking at potential vehicles. If you don't already know your credit score, it helps to find out. The higher the credit score, the better chance you have of negotiating a lower interest rate on an auto loan. \n\nIf your credit score is less than satisfactory, review your credit report to find out what might be negatively affecting your score. Determine if there are any immediate actions you can take to raise your credit score quickly. For example, if you discover that you have accounts in collection, negotiate a pay off with the original creditor in exchange for removing the derogatory item from your credit report. If you have a recent late payment that's creating a blemish, simply ask the creditor if it can be removed as a courtesy.\n\n__2. Review Your Loan Options__\nNow that you have your credit in great shape (or at least improving), it's time to think about how to finance your next vehicle. \n\nYou can certainly apply for an auto loan at the car dealership, but it helps to know all your options before you step foot on the showroom floor. If you have an existing relationship with a bank or credit union, check out their auto loan interest rates. \n\nIf you're approved for a loan before visiting a dealership, it can save you time at the car dealership and also give you an advantage when negotiating the final sale price of the car you choose. \n\nWhen you do choose a car and you're ready to talk numbers with a car salesman, you can still find out what finance deals they have to offer. Some manufacturers authorize promotional interest rates (sometimes as low as 0.0% to 1.9%) that may beat out any interest rate offered by your lending institution. Depending on what the dealership can offer, you have the option of forgoing the bank loan in favor of financing through the dealership. \n\n__3. Discover Your Car's Trade-In Value__\nIf you currently have a car that you plan to trade in, don't wait for the salesman to tell you what it's worth. Do some research on your own to get a good sense of its value. \n\nUse Kelley Blue Book's online tools to input the specific details of your vehicle, including the year, make, model, mileage and condition. If there are minor cosmetic repairs needed, consider making them yourself to increase your old car's net value. \n\nOnce you obtain an estimated trade-in value for your vehicle, you can go into the car dealership equipped with the information you need to negotiate and accept an offer that gets you the most money for your old car. \n\nIt's also worth noting that if you have the time and inclination, you'll almost always get more money for your old vehicle if you sell it yourself than you will if you trade it in. \n\n__4. Determine Your Desired Payment__\nIt's important to understand the factors that impact your auto loan terms and fees so that you can figure out what monthly payment you can afford. \n\nThe key pieces of information you need to calculate your monthly payment are the loan amount, the annual percentage rate (APR) and the term. \n\nUsing an online auto loan calculator can help you experiment with different numbers to find out what works best for you. \n\nFirst, enter the APR offered by your lender. Next, decide on the term you want; this might be anywhere from two years to eight or more year. Lastly, estimate a purchase price. Be sure to deduct the value of your current vehicle if you're selling it or trading it in. \n\nYou may also want to consider putting a down payment on your new car to arrive at a smaller loan amount. \n\nOnce you calculate a monthly payment, decide whether it works with your budget. If you're not comfortable with the number, tweak the loan factors until you reach a payment you can handle. Perhaps you could lower your targeted purchase price, stretch the car loan out for another year (which also means paying more in interest) or put a larger down payment on the new vehicle.\n\n__5. Decide on Buying or Leasing__\nWhen you arrive at the auto dealership, the car salesman is likely to ask you whether you're interested in buying or leasing a car. This is a decision that you can research and make before you even start car shopping. \n\nThink of buying and leasing as owning versus renting. \n\nIf you buy, you're financing the entire cost of the vehicle (minus any trade-in or down payment). If you choose to lease a car, you pay the cost for the length of time that you have it, calculated by subtracting the car's value at the end of your lease from its value when you first took possession of the vehicle. \n\nWhen making the lease or buy decision, ask yourself some questions. First, how much do you drive? There's usually a limit to how many miles you can put on a leased vehicle before you have to pay additional fees. If you travel a great deal, leasing may not be the best choice for you. \n\nNext, do you keep your car in good shape? With a lease, you may have to pay a penalty for returning a car that's not in good condition. \n\nFinally, is there a possibility of major life changes occurring during the term of your lease? There's often a fee involved in terminating a lease agreement early. \n\n__6.  Make the New Versus Used Decision __\nBuying and leasing isn't the only decision you have to make during the car buying process. The next choice you face is whether to get a new car or a used car. \n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to each, so take the time to weigh your options carefully. \n\nA new car has zero miles on the odometer, so it's true that it depreciates as soon as you drive it off the sales lot. On the plus side, loans for new cars typically come with lower interest rates. While the purchase price of a new car is certainly higher than that of a used, the maintenance bills and repair costs are likely to be lower. Finally, the warranty on a new car is almost always better than one on a used vehicle. \n\nIf you decide on a used car, you can enjoy the lower purchase price and potential for lower insurance premiums. Registration and license fees may also be less, as some are based on the value of the vehicle you purchase. One downside to purchasing a used car is that you're left with a reduced, or even no, manufacturer's warranty, though you can buy additional warranties. Further, you'll have to do some additional investigation into the history of each used car you consider to make sure you're not buying a lemon.\n\n__7. Analyze Models That Meet Your Needs__\nNow comes the time to narrow your car choices down to the perfect vehicle for you. It's all about assessing your needs. \n\nTo determine what factors are most important to you in a car, make a list of what you really want in a car. Is safety a top concern for you? Do you need something with great gas mileage? Do you demand a convertible top? You already know a price range that you're comfortable with, so that can help focus your search. \n\nNext, decide on a body style that fits your priorities. If you need lots of seating, a minivan may be the way to go. Looking for something that will haul a boat or camper? Narrow your search to sport-utility vehicles and pick-up trucks. If a sleek look is your priority, consider looking at coupes and sports cars. Those who desire storage space should focus on hatchbacks and station wagons. Hybrid and electric vehicles appeal to those who rank eco-friendliness as a top priority. \n\nOnce you find the body style that suits you, research the car makes and models available. Decide on other factors such as transmission, drivetrain and engine size to zero in on the perfect new car for you. Read car reviews on specific models and years to get all the inside information.\n\n__8. Research Dealership Reputations__\nNow that you've narrowed your car search down to one or a few specific models, it's time for the fun part: test driving. You can shop at one particular dealership or visit several car lots to check out all your options. \n\nFinding a fair and reputable dealership can help you get the best deal possible and avoid headaches. Do some research online to get to know more about the car dealerships in your area. Read reviews from other customers to find out what experiences they've had. Ask your family, friends and neighbors for recommendations. They should be able to direct you to a dealership or even a salesman that provides an excellent customer experience. \n\nA good dealer won't pressure you to buy; instead, they'll take the time to answer your questions and show you the various models. Just remember to be respectful of their time...after all, they are trying to make a living. \n\n__9. Dig Into the Car's History__\nAfter you test drive a few models and settle on one particular car, don't feel like you have to start discussing the numbers right away. While the particular model might have excellent reviews, you want to make sure this specific car is living up to its name. Looking at the car's history can give you a lot of information, including the number of past owners and any accidents that have been reported. \n\nYou can use services like CARFAX and AutoCheck to look up a particular can by its VIN and view the history. Check out the car's repair history to make sure that it's been serviced and maintained properly, such as receiving regular oil changes. As a car buyer, it's also your right to have a mechanic look over the car before you make a purchase. While you will have to pay for the car inspection, a trusted mechanic can point out potential issues that might cost you thousands of dollars down the road.\n\n__10. Brush Up on Your Negotiation Skills__\nOnce you're sure of the car you want to buy, it's time to start the negotiations. Do your research ahead of time so you can arrive at the car dealership armed with information and walk away with the best price. Check out other cars with the same year, make, model and similar mileage, and compare the sticker price at other dealerships. Consult market analysis reports to get a fair value, and consider the demand for a vehicle. If demand is low, it's likely that you can get a better deal on the car. \n\nIf you already have your own financing lined up, you can still ask the dealer about any low-interest finance options they may be offering. It's also a good idea to inquire about rebates or cash back incentives. When you're ready to haggle, put your emotions aside and remember that you're conducting a business transaction. Focus on the price you want to pay for the car. If the salesman asks for your top dollar, quote a number that's lower so you eventually settle somewhere near your target price. Have a calculator or app ready to crunch the numbers and ensure the price works out to a monthly payment that you're comfortable carrying.\n\nWhile the thought of car buying may leave you feeling stressed, there's plenty you can do to ease the pressure. With careful preparation and research, you can feel confident that you're making the right decision and getting a great deal.

If you buy a car out-of-state and bring it to your home state, though, it's not always clear which state should receive the tax, since tax laws vary by state. Before you go car buying across state lines, make sure you know how to pay the state sales tax correctly, so you don't get a tax evasion fine.\n\n__If I Buy a Car in Another State, Where Do I Pay Sales Tax?__\n\nTypically, when you buy a car in a different state than your home state, the dealer collects your sales tax and sends it to the relevant agency in your home state. That way, you don't have to deal with the fuss of trying to follow each state's tax laws. Before the Department of Motor Vehicles in your home state can register your new car, they may check the bill of sale to ensure you paid the sales tax, so you shouldn't try to skimp on paying it. Dealers often tax out-of-state buyers the amount they'd pay if they lived there, so you may have to make up the difference if your home state's tax rate is higher. To avoid confusion when you register at the DMV, make sure you get a bill of sale for your vehicle purchase with the tax included. You don't want to pay a second sales tax just because the dealer forgot to send the appropriate paperwork to your local DMV. Also, keep in mind that there are approximately 10,000 sales tax jurisdictions in the U.S., including cities, counties and other districts, and each jurisdiction has its own tax laws. You may have to pay local taxes on top of state ones.\n\n__How Much Sales Tax Do I Need to Pay for My Motor Vehicle?__\n\nHow much sales tax you need to pay depends on the laws of your home state and the state in which you bought the car. Some states have reciprocal tax relationships, meaning they provide credits to each other whenever their residents pay sales taxes across state lines. For example, Arizona has reciprocal tax agreements with Oregon, Virginia, Indiana and California. If a California resident buys a car in Arizona, they may be exempt from paying the sales tax in Arizona, though they must still pay it in California. Your state's DMV most likely lists the state's tax relationships with other states, so you should check their web page before making a purchase. Even if you visit a non-reciprocal state, you may be able to avoid paying the sales tax in that state if you give the dealer proof that you intend to register your car in your home state, such as your driver's license. If you buy your car from a private seller instead of a dealer, you can pay the sales tax when you register the vehicle in your home state. If you take this approach, though, the DMV in your home state may need to check the car's vehicle identification number to ensure it matches the out-of-state title.\n\nWhen transferring cars between states, remember that legal differences between states extend beyond taxes. Some states require a smog test before registering a vehicle to ensure it meets emissions requirements. The California Air Resources Board is notably stringent in this respect. Similarly, safety standards between states often clash. If you buy a car in another state, there's no guarantee you can register it in your home state, even if you've already paid for the vehicle and all associated taxes. Also, car taxes between states vary widely. As of 2019, New York has a car tax rate of 4 percent plus local taxes, whereas Pennsylvania has a state car tax rate of 6 percent, with some local rates much higher. \n\n__What About Special Circumstances?__\n\nBecause U.S. state tax laws vary so much, there are many individual circumstances to take into account when buying a car in another state. Most states provide tax credits for trade-ins — that is when you give your old car to a dealer to cover part of the cost of a new car. However, California, Michigan, Oklahoma, Virginia and District of Columbia don't do this. Also, if you buy a used car instead of a new one, you must still pay a sales tax. You don't need to pay the tax to the dealer or private party when buying the used car, but you do need to pay it when you register the vehicle in your home state. Also, some states, such as California, charge use fees when you bring in a car from out-of-state, even if you've already paid the sales tax on the vehicle. In Oklahoma, you must pay an excise tax on the car's value when you register it. Some states charge yearly excise fees for cars or a fee whenever you renew your registration. These fees are in addition to the sales tax you must pay.\n\n__What Are Some Loopholes to Avoid Paying Sales Tax on Cars?__\n\nSales taxes on cars are often hefty, so you may try to avoid paying them. The easiest way to do so is to buy a car in a state with no sales taxes and register the car there. There are five states without sales taxes: Montana, Alaska, Delaware, Oregon and New Hampshire. Unfortunately, unless you register the vehicle in the sales-tax-free state, you still have to pay the sales tax when you register the car in your home state, and using dummy addresses doesn't fool revenue departments. If you plan to move from a state without sales taxes to one with sales taxes, you should buy the car and register it about three months before your move. This way, you don't have to pay a sales tax on your vehicle in the new state when you re-register it. There are other loopholes, too. Cars built before 1973 are typically exempt from sales taxes, and vehicles used for certain types of farming are as well. You also don't need to pay the sales tax if you're disabled. Just make sure you include a tax exemption disc on your vehicle to display your status. Finally, you may receive tax deductions on your vehicle if you add it in your tax filing, such as if your car meets low-emission criteria. These deductions can mitigate the sales tax you have to pay when buying the car.\n\nSales taxes are tricky when you buy a car out-of-state. Generally, you pay the dealer the sales tax, and the dealer sends the revenue to your home state, but exceptions abound. Make sure you consult your local DMV before making a purchase across state lines.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["States"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-04-26T17:15:13.831Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4nWPDaDWTQaZszg0BzF1K9/0dbe186f93e85253b34ac5e15856a54d/best-trade-in-value-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/14uGZGEjFxYSWuHIAyHe8b/90971f6e82e597d8c746526c820c161c/best-trade-in-value-325-image.jpg","slug":"how-to-trade-in-a-car","title":"How To Trade In a Car (and get the best value)","publication_date":"2019-04-22T08:44-08:00","content_summary":"Learn how to trade in your car for a new vehicle and get the best offer.

As long as your current vehicle is in reasonable shape, you can give it to a dealer in exchange for credit toward the purchase of a new car, eliminating the need to sell to a private party. To get the best trade-in value, though, it's crucial that you do your research and avoid common mistakes. All the paperwork involved in trade-ins can get dizzying, and you may lose money if you're not careful.\n\n__How to Trade in Your Car: Preparation__\n\nBefore bringing your used vehicle to a car dealer for the trade-in process, you should figure out the car's value by consulting a price guide. The Edmunds and Kelley Blue Book price guides, for example, provide fair price listings for a wide range of cars, factoring in details such as a car's mileage and condition. Also, look to the NADA Guides (National Automobile Dealers Association) for input on your vehicle's value. \n\nCarMax, a used-car retailer, also provides appraisal services. You simply bring your current car to CarMax for a detailed inspection, and CarMax makes a written purchase offer that's good for seven days. You can even use this offer as proof of your car's value at a dealership. Once you have a good estimate of the purchase price of your car, you're ready to haggle with potential buyers.\n\nNext, gather up all the important items associated with your automobile that must be handed over during a trade-in, such as your license, title, keys and registration, and make appointments at several dealerships so you can compare offers. \n\nWhen you go to the dealerships, don't forget to bring your Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book or CarMax price appraisals, so you can back up the market price of the car. Also, bring any car loan documents if you have an unpaid auto loan on the vehicle. \n\nAlthough you shouldn't worry about reconditioning your vehicle before selling it, since you're unlikely to recoup the cost of those fixes, it's a good idea to make the car as presentable as possible, such as by cleaning up any messes under the seats and driving the car through a car wash. If it's a nicer car with plenty of value left in it, consider a decent detailing service; you'd be surprised how nice it will make your vehicle look -- inside and out.\n\n__How Do Car Trade-Ins Work?__\n\nWhen you take your old car to a dealer for a trade-in, they usually test-drive and inspect it before making a trade-in offer. Since most people don't know how to trade in a car for the best price, some dealers may low-ball the car's value, and they can be aggressive negotiators. For this reason, you should stand your ground, just as if you were making a private-party sale. Just keep in mind that dealers are a business and they do need to make a profit on your vehicle, so you may not get the exact market average for your car (and you'll certainly get less than if you sold it privately).\n\nIf you still owe money on an old loan for your car, the dealership can take the loan from you after the trade-in. After the amount of the loan is subtracted from your car's value, any equity left over is subtracted from the price of the new car. However, if you're upside-down on your loan, meaning you owe more on the loan than the car is worth, then the dealer can add the negative equity to the balance of the new car loan. \n\nThis strategy might be tempting, especially if you need a new vehicle right away and don't have much money to spend on paying down your loan first, but it's also risky. As soon as you drive off the lot in your shiny new Ford or Toyota, its value depreciates, pushing you further into the red. When it comes time to trade in for your next car and get a new loan, the negative equity is going to follow you. If you can't pay back the underwater loan and missed payments appear on your credit report, your credit score may suffer. You may find it easier to pay off any negative equity with credit cards before making a trade-in.\n\n__Other Considerations When Making Trade-Ins__\n\nKnowing when to trade in cars can be tricky to figure out. Generally, you want to trade in your car when it's in high demand, as dealers are more likely to give you greater offers. In addition, you can sometimes get better offers at the end of the year, since dealers are trying to make room for new models and may make more generous trade-ins to get vehicles off their hands. \n\nRemember that you can trade in your car even if you're leasing it, though it's generally only wise to do this if a dealer offers you more than the buyout cost of your lease. That way, you can pay off the lease contract and fund a down payment on the new car. \n\nOne advantage of making a trade-in is that, in many states, you only have to pay a sales tax on the new car price minus the trade-in value, not the entire car cost. \n\nAnother consideration when car buying is that you may get a better trade-in deal if the price of your new car is high since the dealer is more eager to get your business.\n\n__Common Mistakes__\n\nTrading in an old car can be intimidating, especially for people who've never done it before. Many common trade-in mistakes stem from small oversights.\n\nAlthough dealers seem intent on helping buyers as much as possible, such as by handling loan transfers, they may charge fees for some of these services. It's always a good idea to include these fees in your decision whether to trade in your car. \n\nAnother mistake is to use price guides that don't include data from the National Automobile Dealers Association, the most reputable authority on the subject. \n\nBuyers also tend to trust the dealer's judgment too much when handling lease and loan details. Even if the final arrangement doesn't serve the buyer's best interest, these details can be confusing, and buyers are usually too exhausted from negotiations to study each document they sign. To ensure you get the best deal, carefully read the dealer's policies in advance and ask any and all questions that come up, so you can sign with confidence.\n\nPerhaps the biggest mistake buyers make is to overestimate the value of their car. Price guides offer the average market values for cars, and dealers want to buy cars below the average to make a profit. It's tempting to cling to the highest value among price guides when trading in your car, especially if you're emotionally attached to your vehicle. Doing so may lead to disappointment when a dealer shoots down your offer. Be honest with yourself when evaluating the condition of your vehicle; most guides will provide a range of values, depending on your vehicle's condition. If you look only at the \"like-new\" values but your car is actually in \"average\" condition, you could have unrealistic expectations of the car's worth.\n\nYet another mistake buyers make is to hide negative information about the car. Dealers can find any registered car's history on Carfax, and they have an eye for flaws regardless, so this approach rarely works. If you claim to have higher offers from other dealers than you do, the dealer is likely to request the offer in writing. Dealers have a good idea of how much other dealers are prepared to deviate from the market average when making a trade-in, so they're not easy to fool.\n\nTo get the best value for your trade-in, you need to learn how much your car is worth, shop around for the best trade-in deals and negotiate with confidence. Trading in your car saves you money and takes your old vehicle off your hands at the same time, making it a win-win opportunity.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Negotiating","Trade-Ins"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-04-23T23:45:05.651Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/71lbonvy1EpIn6KriB1djx/6cdb373cedb96bd75e820e8007f3423d/buying-cars-without-title-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2IBOtpvLuEVagVUMieM9N9/dbbbd5cec62d59bbf016a772da1aee34/buying-cars-without-title-325-image.jpg","slug":"buying-cars-without-title","title":"Buying Cars Without a Title - What You Need to Know","publication_date":"2019-04-19T08:32-08:00","content_summary":"Buying a car without a title is a risky endeavor, but not an impossible one.

The price is right, but there’s one catch; the seller does not have the title to the vehicle. A car’s title is its declaration of ownership. If you buy a car that has no title, it is altogether possible that the person holding the title could claim to own the car, even after you plunk down your hard-earned dough to buy it. What’s more, to register the vehicle in your name, you will need the title, since this proves your ownership during registration. If you can’t register the car, you can’t insure the car or drive it legally. So, are you out of luck? Or can the issue of having no title rectified? Let’s delve further into missing titles and the ramifications of such on your used vehicle purchase.\n\n__Why is the Title Missing?__\n\nOne of the first things you should ask the seller of the car is “why is the title missing?” Hopefully, the seller is truthful and has an explanation that makes sense and that can be somehow backed up by evidence. After all, there are a few possibilities as to why the seller of the car may not have the title. Some of them are legitimate. Others may be downright shady. The title could have been lost or misplaced, or it could have been damaged or destroyed. Perhaps the title was stolen. Inversely and more ominously, it could be a stolen car. A missing title might also indicate that it is a “flood” car that has been underwater in its past, or it might be an indicator of a vehicle with a salvage title, which isn’t altogether a bad thing. Another possibility is that the seller is participating in what is known as \"title jumping.\" That involves two or more individuals selling cars without going through the title process, generally to avoid the payment of sales tax. The practice is illegal in every U.S. state.\n\n__Check the Vehicle’s History__\n\nThe vehicle identification number, or VIN, on a motor vehicle can be invaluable in finding out its history. Services such as AutoCheck and Carfax can help you confirm the legal and title status of the vehicle. These services also provide reports about the odometer, previous accidents involving the car, insurance claims associated with the VIN, and more. If you run a report and find information that is contrary to what the seller is telling you, you might want to tuck tail and run the other way at this point.\n\n__Check With the Previous Owner__ \n\nIf the seller has a bill of sale from the previous owner of the car, use it to track the person down online or based on the info on the paperwork. Ask the previous owner to help you obtain a title for the car, and offer to pay any costs incurred in doing so.\n\n__Check With the DMV__\n\nA local DMV office may be able to answer some basic questions about the car in question by running a VIN search. It is possible that you can uncover information about the vehicle’s history in your state. You can also confirm the status of the title with the DMV clerk. Keep in mind that the DMV is limited on the information they can give you; for example, any confidential information, such as names and addresses, will probably be off limits.\n\n__Check the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB)__\n\nThe NICB offers a free VinCheck service to help the public determine the legal status of a vehicle. The service will determine if the vehicle has been stolen and if it has not yet been recovered by law enforcement. It can also alert you as to whether the vehicle has been reported as a salvage or junk car by an insurance company.\n\n__Proceeding with the Sale__\n\nIf everything seems to “check out,” then you may decide to proceed with the sale. At this point, you have a few options to consider:\n\n* Have the seller request a duplicate title. Although the form you’ll need to fill out varies by state, the seller can submit a request. They will need to provide his name and address, the VIN for the car, the car’s mileage, and proof of identity. It will take a few days for the duplicate title request to be processed and a new title issued. If the information provided by the seller is false or inaccurate, then it can result in a rejection of the new title. It is best practice to delay the purchase until the new title is in the seller’s hands.\n\n* Complete a bill of sale. If you don’t want to wait for the new title to arrive, you might want to complete a bill of sale. It is an essential part of the sales process for any vehicle sale, but it is doubly important if there is no title present. Before you pay for the car, write out a bill of sale that includes the sale’s details, including the VIN, sale price, and the car’s odometer reading. Be sure to include that the seller to supply title on the bill of sale and to include complete info on yourself and the seller. This includes all contact information, including full legal names, driver's licenses, addresses and phone numbers.\n\n* Go for a surety bond title. It's not available in all states, but it generally requires submitting proof of purchase and residency as well as proof that the care is not a salvage vehicle. Once everything is verified by the surety bond company, you pay a percentage of the bond amount. A bonded title indication can be removed from the title within three to five years, provided no issues arise with the title in the interim. After that, you can get a clean title in most cases.\n\n__Some Points to Consider__\n\nBefore taking the plunge and going for a motor vehicle without a title, it’s important to remember that in most states it is illegal to buy or sell a car without a title and to drive a car without a title. Still, people do it all the time, much like jaywalking, regardless of it being illegal. A bill of sale does not wield the same power as a title, so you may be questioned about ownership until you have the actual title in hand. Moreover, the replacement process can be lengthy. It will not be possible to register the car at the DMV or insure the vehicle during that time, so it makes the car undrivable until your replacement title is in hand. You can’t get license plates for the car in most states anyway by using just the paperwork for a lost title.\n\n__Is It Worth the Hassle?__\n\nIf all of this seems like a lot of work, it can be. While it is often possible to replace a car title yourself, the paperwork involved and the time you will spend at the Department of Motor Vehicles make the prospect unattractive to most folks. You may want to ask yourself if the time spent on a lost or missing title is worth it. Weigh your frustration and the time required to correct the title issue against the vast inventory of used cars on the market to determine if you want to invest any elbow grease in getting a title for the vehicle. It is more than likely that you might buy the same car or a similar car elsewhere with no title issues. By contrast, if the vehicle really is hard to find, you may consider it time well-spent and not mind putting in extra effort to become its owner. Ultimately, the choice to purchase a car without a vehicle title or not depends on just how much you want the car in question and how much you’re willing to do to own it.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Licensing"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-04-19T22:09:32.840Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/336sWQ3qN9MDHuUKb3JuLX/36cf83176f5a5c3d5115367aba54ebd4/awd-vs-fwd-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/145HWvNawkavXAv9n7oRqf/9fce94c2ac2eb2aaf53c1e6b912f61ee/awd-vs-fwd-325.jpg","slug":"awd-vs-fwd","title":"AWD vs FWD - What Should I Get?","publication_date":"2019-04-17T09:11-08:00","content_summary":"In the market for a new all-wheel drive vehicle but still undecided?

In FWD vehicles, the engine only powers the front axle, whereas, in AWD vehicles, the engine powers both front and rear axles.\n\n__Here's a brief rundown on the four types of wheel drive systems:__\n\n__Front-Wheel-Drive:__ The vast majority of new cars on the road today are front-wheel drive vehicles, including almost all models of SUVs. Front-wheel drive SUVs come equipped with additional parts that automatically route some of the engine's power to the rear axle when necessary. Since the drivetrain is positioned in the front and pulls the weight of the vehicle, the effect of oversteer (rear end of the vehicle sliding out and causing a tighter turn than intended) is limited. FWD cars are good at climbing hills and perform well in slippery conditions. From a manufacturer's standpoint, FWD vehicles are beneficial because they are cheaper to manufacture and use space more efficiently. \n\n__Rear-Wheel-Drive:__ Rear-drive systems are usually found in sports cars, pickup trucks, older truck-based SUVs and luxury high-performance sedans. It is a two-wheel drive system that pushes the car from the rear axle. Rear-wheel drive systems (RWD) enable better handling in performance cars by distributing weight more evenly. Also, since the front wheels aren't in charge of both steering and powering the vehicle, makers of rear-wheel-drive vehicles are free to tune the suspension system for handling superiority. These days, most performance RWD cars typically have AWD options available as well. RWD trucks are made with robust and heavy parts that provide better traction when hauling a heavy load. RWD vehicles have inferior traction control when road conditions are slippery, however. \n\n__All-Wheel-Drive:__ AWD systems deliver power to each corner of the vehicle, similar to 4WD cars. However, unlike 4WD cars, AWD is always engaged and provides varying amounts of power to the axles depending on traction conditions. All-wheel drive systems primarily power one set of axles, either front or rear. When the car feels traction loss in one axle, it will automatically divert more power to the other axle to compensate. Not all AWD systems utilize the same power ratio. For example, Subaru's all-wheel-drive system continuously sends at least 20% of the engines power output to the rear axle, with the possibility of directing more if necessary. Other systems exclusively power the front axle and only rebalance engine output to the rear when the front tires are losing traction.\n\nAWD cars work well in moderate off-road driving situations, or when driving conditions are prone to change due to terrain variation or volatile weather conditions. In addition, AWD vehicles provide great overall traction during acceleration due to all four wheels being engaged. AWD systems are commonly found in car-based SUVs and minivans, but also often make an appearance as an option for performance rear-wheel-drive cars.\n\n__Four-Wheel Drive:__ Four-wheel drive (4WD) cars are generally tuned for extreme off-road uses like traversing over deep water, scaling boulders or climbing steep hills with poor surface traction. When enabled, 4WD systems send power to all four wheels using front and rear differentials plus a transfer case that distributes power equally regardless of traction. In addition, some 4WD have two gear ranges, high and low. The low gear range proves especially helpful when low-speed climbing power is required. There are three different mode toggle options in modern four-wheel drive vehicles. Full-time systems are always engaged, automatic systems switch between 2WD and 4WD automatically, and part-time systems require the driver to switch between two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive modes manually. Driving a part-time 4WD vehicle on the pavement with 4WD enabled can cause damage to the vehicle's drivetrain.\n\n__Is an All-Wheel-Drive or Four-Wheel-Drive vehicle worth it?__\n\nIt depends on the driving conditions you plan to encounter. Two-wheel-drive cars handle rain and light snowfall just fine, with front-wheel-drive cars generally eking out rear-wheel cars in safety. Rear-wheel-drive cars excel when performance is critical (although all-wheel-drive systems can provide more traction). All-wheel drive vehicles are great for light off-road driving and typical snow conditions. If you're powering through heavy snow or tackling extreme off-road terrain, a four-wheel-drive vehicle with high ground clearance and a low gear range is the set of wheels you should be looking for.\n\nIn addition to weather and terrain conditions, fuel efficiency is another factor that should be considered. Both four-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive systems contribute substantial heft to the vehicle, so you end up trading efficient fuel economy for that extra traction. And sending power to all four wheels when it isn't necessary also contributes to more drag and reduced efficiency. Some all-wheel-drive systems now automatically disconnect power going to the rear axle when the system determines the front two have sufficient traction.\n\n__Traversing Winter Terrain__\n\nSafety and handling is another concern. Many potential car buyers view all-wheel drive and four-wheel drive SUVs as safer due to the increased traction they provide. However, that straight traction contributes absolutely nothing to assist in safer turning or braking, especially when ice is a factor. Sure, the robust traction is helpful when you need to get going, but stopping is another story. Four-wheel drive and all-wheel drive cars are involved in icier condition-related accidents than their lighter two-wheel drive counterparts, and their drivers' misconceptions about the limitations of their 4WD and AWD drivetrains certainly plays a part. Even on dry streets, heavier four-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive vehicles require more distance to come to a complete halt. \n\nWhen driving through winter weather, you can't go wrong with a set of winter tires. Numerous independent studies have shown that good tires play the largest part in determining a vehicle's safety performance when driving through snow and ice. That is because snow tires are made from a softer kind of rubber than standard tires. Their more pliable texture enables superior traction when the temperature drops. Besides, winter tires feature specialized treads that are designed to carve into the snow and eject it out of the way. Snow tires are embossed with a three-peak mountain and snowflake logo, so it's easy to see if the tire you're looking at passes snow performance standards and is rated for winter driving. \n\n### To Sum it Up:\n\nIf you are mainly looking to drive in the city, a two-wheel drive car is all you need. Throw a set of winter tires on when going through light snowfall and it will perform fine. This is the cheapest option, since all-wheel drive vehicles are more expensive right out of the dealer and less fuel efficient, leading to increased expenses down the line. A front-wheel drive vehicle is more versatile and less prone to oversteer. If you live in a warm, dry climate and are a performance enthusiast, a rear-wheel-drive car might be right for you.\n\nWhen you want a mix of urban driving and rural performance, nothing beats the versatility of an all-wheel-drive vehicle. All-wheel-drive cars are jacks-of-all-trades and can weather harsh winter conditions when equipped with a good set of snow tires. All-wheel drive cars also redistribute power automatically, so you don't have to worry about fumbling with controls and can focus on the road.\n\nFor heavy high incline off-roading and trudging through unplowed roads, a four-wheel drive car with a low gear range and high clearance provides the best mobility. Just remember to enable the right settings for the terrain, as failing to do so can damage your drivetrain.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Drivetrains"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-04-18T19:31:20.278Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7cLa2vSd0Cdbo48oTQPiar/ddbc57eb8924963a50758771deccde13/fwd-vs-rwd-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2qG7ddkv315Y2SnlcT2vPO/d44431e4424f67398d50becc31aa0ef9/fwd-vs-rwd-325-image.jpg","slug":"fwd-vs-rwd","title":"FWD vs RWD - What's Better?","publication_date":"2019-04-16T09:17-08:00","content_summary":"Front-wheel and rear-wheel drive systems each have their benefits and drawbacks, from handling and traction to fuel-efficiency.

The layout you should pick when buying your next car depends on your driving preferences and how you plan to use your vehicle.\n\n__What Are FWD and RWD?__\n\nMost modern cars have front-wheel drive. Typically, the engine and transmission in FWD cars are mounted at the front of the vehicles transversely, and these parts send power to the front two wheels, which pull the vehicle on their own. By contrast, rear-wheel drive cars transfer power from the engine to the rear wheels only. Most RWD cars built have the engine mounted in the front, but some rear-drive vehicles have engines in the middle or rear of the car instead – most typical in sports cars.\n\n__The Benefits of Front-Wheel-Drive__\n\nOne of the main advantages that front-wheel-drive cars have over RWD vehicles is their improved traction, which results from their weight distribution. In front-wheel-drive vehicles, the weight of the engine above the front tires allows the tires to grip the road more effectively. This extra traction makes front-drive cars useful when it snows or when you need to navigate poorly paved roads. Since pulling is more effective than pushing when a vehicle has to dislodge itself from mud or snow, FWD vehicles are especially great for getting out of low-traction parking spots. When equipped with winter tires, a front-wheel-drive vehicle can manage winter trips much more reliably than RWDs.\n\nIn addition to better traction, FWD cars typically have more room than vehicles with rear-wheel-drive. That's because the transverse engines in most FWDs don't extend to the interior compartment space, unlike in rear-wheel-drive cars. Many RWDs require a central tunnel through the middle of the car that creates a hump in the floor of the passenger area, to cover the driveshaft joining the rear wheels and engine. This extra room in front-wheel-drive vehicles ensures passengers are more comfortable and allows for extra storage space. FWD cars also tend to be cheaper to manufacture. Since front-drive powertrains are produced as single units, building FWDs requires fewer parts, making for less expensive assembly. Front-drive powertrains are also lighter than the transmission and axle assemblies in RWDs, so they get better gas mileage, saving you money. Many economy cars are FWDs because they're more cost and space-efficient. The more compact designs of FWDs also ensures they can be manufactured smaller than RWDs.\n\n__The Drawbacks of Front-Wheel-Drive__\n\nOne of the most significant drawbacks of FWDs is their handling. Although their traction is superior in bad weather, they don't take corners as precisely as rear-drives do. The pressure that both power and steering mechanisms put on the front axle tends to tax the front tires, creating a less dexterous feeling while driving. Sometimes, you might even feel the car is not responding to your steering very well or has a tendency to have a delay in your inputs. This problem is most noticeable when driving fast. Front-drive models wear out their tires quicker as a result of their front-loaded hardware, costing you more in repairs in the long-term. Also, the nose-heavy layout of FWDs sometimes makes them succumb to torque steer, a condition in which rapid acceleration causes the vehicle to drift left or right on its own. As a result, most high-performance sports cars choose rear-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive layouts. Fortunately, electronic traction control in many modern FWDs helps to mitigate torque steer and related problems.\n\nWhen driving a front-wheel drive vehicle, you may notice that the car turns too wide, as transversely mounted engines allow less space for the front wheels to turn. That makes large FWD sometimes challenging to make U-turns in.\n\n__The Benefits of Rear-Wheel-Drive__\n\nRear-wheel drive vehicles represent the most historically traditional layout of the automobile, even though cars with RWD aren't as conventional in the 21st century. For most of the automobile's history, this wheel drive system was the only one available, so many classic cars are RWD by default. The key advantage of the rear-wheel layout is that each set of tires has just one task, ensuring an equal amount of stress on both: The front set steers, while the rear set provides power. Rear-wheel cars can manage turns more smoothly as a result. To make especially tight turns, the driver of an RWD can raise or lower throttle to create a power slide, although this technique is usually illegal on public roads. The balanced feel of RWDs is why performance cars use the system.\n\nRear-wheel-drive cars can tow trailers more efficiently than FWDs because the weight of the trailers gives the rear tires of the RWD more traction. Plus, the RWD's front tires, being less burdened than those of an FWD, can usually more accurately maneuver the trailer through traffic. Rear-wheel-drive vehicle platforms have more flexible designs, as the engine can sit in the front, middle or back of the car, whereas front-wheel cars require the engine to sit at the front. RWDs can also handle larger engines because the weight and power of that larger powerplant are less likely to burden the front wheels.\n\nThe ability to handle more power is why many law enforcement agencies continue to use rear-wheel-drive sedans as pursuit vehicles, even though changes in vehicle construction over the decades has made the durability differences between front and rear-drive cars less significant. \n\n__The Drawbacks of Rear-Wheel-Drive__\n\nAlthough rear-wheel-drive cars have many advantages over FWDs, their inferior traction remains a big drawback, especially when it rains or snows. Severely bad weather, such as a snowstorm, can make rear-wheel-drive cars very difficult for drivers to maintain control. Less traction also means RWDs can't climb steep grades as easily or keep as tight a course on muddy or poorly paved roads. Getting out of snowbound parking spots is especially tricky for RWDs, helped only by manually selecting gears or through a preset snow mode on some automatic transmission-equipped vehicles. If you plan to drive a rear-wheel-drive car just about anywhere during the winter, make sure the car has winter tires. Otherwise, you're apt to slide all over the road and pose a danger to you and others on the streets. Also, rear-wheel systems are more complex than front-wheel ones, so they cost more to make and are more expensive on the lot. Also, most fuel-efficient modern cars don't have the power required to make advanced driving techniques easy to pull off with RWDs.\n\n__Which Wheels Are the Best Wheels to Drive?__\n\nWhether you prefer the fuel economy and fine traction of front-wheel-drive vehicles or the handling and performance aspects of rear-wheel drive ones can help you decide which system is right for you. Most modern cars have front-wheel drive, which probably best suits drivers who have no interest in track days or autocross courses. However, rear-wheel cars have a classic feel many professional racers and proportions that luxury car enthusiasts find essential. \n\nIf neither layout works for you, perhaps you're best off with an all-wheel-drive vehicle. AWD vehicles provide power to all four wheels, ensuring a balance of traction and handling that's ideal for a wide range of driving conditions and the ability to handle high levels of power. All that matters is that you find a system that suits you.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Drivetrains"],"ctaText":"Browse Listins","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-04-16T21:51:59.038Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/30UMaym2dId1jw0QABm8SB/2d6bf0ff0a49b784123c6b0c5cf2dd2e/best-place-to-sell-car-online-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1cquheP5Y9YTn8AYLPU4CN/cb98d8897bfb22fc23ca1226a04d0442/best-place-to-sell-car-online-325-image.jpg","slug":"best-place-to-sell-car-online","title":"What Is The Best Place to Sell a Car Online?","publication_date":"2019-04-15T11:28-08:00","content_summary":"Find out the best place to sell cars online and why they are the most popular among sellers, including such sites as eBay, Craigslist and Cars.com.","parent_page":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides","slug":"guides"},"categories":[{"name":"Buying Guides","description":"Guides that help buyers with their automotive purchase.","parentCategory":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides"}}],"category":{"name":"Buying Guides","description":"Guides that help buyers with their automotive purchase.","parentCategory":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides"}},"author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"body":"When it comes to unloading a used car, you primarily have three options. You can either sell it to a private party, sell it to a dealership or use it as a trade-in for a new car. Both of the latter options are unlikely to get you much for your vehicle, and especially if your car is very old and has a lot of miles. These days you have a range of options when it comes to selling your vehicle privately, thanks to all the online car sites like cars.com and eBay among others. These sites bring a lot of eyes to your ad and raise the chances that you'll get your asking price. So, where is the best place to sell a car online? Consider the following five as some of the top sites to sell your car online.\n\n__1. eBay Motors__\n\neBay is one of the top places to sell cars online, and for good reason as it boasts over 160 million buyers. You have two options when selling a vehicle on eBay. The first is a fixed-price listing and the second is via auctions. It's free to list your car on eBay initially, but when it sells, eBay charges a fee based on the sale price. With a fixed-price listing, you sell your used car similarly to any other classified ad. Post your asking price and then a button for 'make offer' is available to buyers if they want to haggle with a lower price. If you decide to use the auction feature, then you'll have buyers bidding on your car. It can be a good way to sell classic cars or to possibly get more than your asking price. To reduce the risk that you won't get your bottom line, make sure to set a 'Buy It Now' price and an undisplayed reserve price, which is the minimum that you'll accept. It does require an additional fee, however. eBay has a slight edge over Craigslist in that it's not entirely as anonymous and the entire transaction can be completed over the website.\n\n__2. Craigslist__\n\nProbably the second most popular place for car selling is Craiglist. It's free, and it offers a massive platform to get eyes on your ad. It also tends to be the first place people check when they're looking locally for a used car. You have plenty of options when you post your ad, including a sizable amount of pictures. The most significant caveat with Craiglist, because it has traditionally been a free-for-all, is that it can be rife with scams. In April 2019, the site announced it would begin charging $5 for used car ads, to curb spam. But it's still important to be aware of the techniques that scammers use and also to make sure that your ad is full of information about the car, which will be more likely to attract legitimately interested buyers instead of scammers. The most common scam of fake buyers on Craigslist is to contact a seller and say that they will pay full price for a car, but that the seller needs to ship it to them. They then say that they will send a check to cover both. The main ways to avoid scammers are to deal in cash, never agree to strange requests, and don't respond to dubious contacts. When you meet someone for a test drive via Craigslist, it's a good idea to look at their driver's license first and also to meet in a safe, neutral area.\n\n__3. Cars.com__\n\nCars.com ranks highly as it has one of the quickest ways to get a used car price estimate. Upon entering seven items on the main page, you will get an instant price range for selling via private party and also dealer retail. You can then pick from the following three options: dealer appraisal, quick offer and placing an ad. If you choose dealer appraisal, you can set up in-person meetings for as many as three dealers at one time for no charge. If you use your own selling ad, then you can expect to reach around 13 million car shoppers each month. If you pay $49 for your listing, then you can include a CARFAX report on your listing, which is a good way to lure in buyers who aren't using the service. If your hometown paper participates with cars.com, then you can have an ad placed there in addition to your online listing. They also offer a free trial for 30 days, which is a good deal considering they claim the average car will sell in less than four days.\n\n__4. CarGurus__\n\nCarGurus has several great tools for sellers, including price analysis, instant market value, and a dealer trade-in estimate. These allows you to see whether your listing will show up as a good deal, fair deal, high price or a bad deal. Although dealers use this site extensively, they don't charge you as a private seller to list your car. You can also look at the vehicles selling in your area and which ones they list as good deals. That allows you to have far more pricing information versus just using Kelley Blue Book, for example. As a popular site for car buying, CarGurus sees over 20 million car shoppers per month. Like Autotrader and Craigslist, this is a classified ad style site. That means you'll need to respond to interested buyers on your own and set up meetings and test drives. Similarly, that usually means that you should only deal with cash. CarGurus does remove some anonymity from the transaction, though, as they do require verified emails.\n\n__5. Autotrader__\n\nAutotrader is one of the oldest ways to sell and buy a car. Before online car sales became popular, they sold a newsprint magazine full of car ads. It was generally considered the best way to see a large number of cars for sale versus the newspaper. Similarly, the Autotrader website has now combined the best features of the print magazine with everything you need to sell your vehicle. They do charge ad fees that range from $25 for a basic one month package to a premium package for $100 that keeps your ad on until it sells. If you don't like the idea of dealing with a potential buyer, then Autotrader can also take over this aspect of the process. The VIP Service will do all the work to sell your car, including giving you an anonymous phone number. If you want to sell your car to a dealer, they will allow you to get a cash offer from any of their participating dealers. Another perk is that your Autotrader ad will also appear on Kelley Blue Book, which brings in more potential buyers. Autotrader's long history does mean that it tends to bring in more serious buyers and fewer scammers.\n\nAlthough you can list a classic car on any of the above popular sites, it's generally more worth your while to list this type of vehicle on an enthusiast site. Autotrader specifically has a section for classic cars, but sites like Hemmings.com and ClassicCars.com tend to be the best car sites for selling vintage vehicles.\n\nThe best website for selling a car depends mostly on the type of vehicle you have and what you're comfortable doing during the sales process.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Selling"],"ctaText":"Browse Used Car Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-05-24T23:47:38.685Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5XaV2RjamcO6Uew6wUOiOy/f6d6e30b7d7099dc06a19a1992a5fd54/carfax-vs-autocheck-image-1166c.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4ZgQ68p6SQQ8UUUSOigeeC/e761e5be0de3028bbefdba28ba3e3c6f/carfax-vs-autocheck-image-325c.jpg","slug":"autocheck-vs-carfax","title":"AutoCheck vs Carfax - Which One Should I Use?","publication_date":"2019-04-14T11:45-07:00","content_summary":"Updated 2019!

While there are many benefits to buying used, doing so also means you'll want to take a peek into the vehicle's background as part of your research before making a decision. After all, even a cheap used car is still a big purchase that's worth pursuing carefully.\n\n![AutoCheck vs Carfax](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2sA13nBcnYsf9KA3icDMLz/e11a7a6a8cff33a6d77cc55132be4c09/autocheck-vs-carfax.jpg)\n\n## The Options\n\nThere are two primary companies that provide information about used cars: AutoCheck and Carfax.\n\nBoth are subscription services and they both deliver a thorough look into the history of a vehicle's service records, potential accidents and emissions records. A vehicle history report will also show salvage titles and other red flags for used vehicles, such as branded titles (sometimes also called salvage titles). \n\nBoth services draw information from the __National Motor Vehicle Title Information System__ (NMVTIS), which is run by the federal Department of Justice. This agency collects its title information from state motor vehicle registries. It's the only publicly-available system in the U.S. that all insurance carriers, auto recyclers, junk yards and salvage yards must report to regularly.\n\nIn other words, both Carfax and Autocheck let you analyze the vehicle's past so you can make an informed purchase. They're very similar services, but there are some key differences you should understand before selecting one.\n\n## Top Things to Know\n\nWhile both Carfax and AutoCheck are useful services, they're only as good as the documentation they're provided. If a body shop makes repairs and fails to update the vehicle's history, that incident won't show up in your report. Likewise, if someone has had a fender-bender and fixes their vehicle themselves or privately without telling the insurance company, you won't see that on the report either.\n\nUnfortunately, this means that a vehicle could theoretically have prior damage without it showing up in the report. Nevertheless, it’s a good idea to obtain a vehicle history report prior to buying a used car.\n\nReports from AutoCheck and Carfax do cost money, particularly if you're buying a used vehicle privately since there won't be a dealer involved who often offers a report from one of these services as part of the sale.\n\nIf you're at the dealership and want to know the history of a given car, request the report. Dealers usually have subscriptions to AutoCheck or Carfax and will run a free report for seriously interested buyers. It __should be considered a red flag__ if any seller -- dealer or private party -- refuses to run a report or provide you with an outdated report.\n\nHere's a look at Carfax versus AutoCheck:\n\n## Carfax\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ivHdfVHCHSw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nCarfax is more well-known than Autocheck and is so named because the company was founded in 1984, before the Internet, when it faxed reports to customers. Both Carfax and Autocheck reports are available on used vehicles and light trucks manufactured in 1981 and beyond.\n\n__Unique Data__\n\nCarfax offers features that Autocheck doesn’t, such as their guaranteed buyback program and information on open recalls. With the guaranteed buyback program, if they made a mistake on your vehicle history report, they will buy the vehicle back from you. For many used car buyers, that kind of reassurance is well-worth the higher cost of admission. \n\n__A Bit More Costly__\n\nCarfax is the more expensive option: As of this writing, a single Carfax report (for a single vehicle) cost $39.99, three costs $59.99 and six is $99.99. For comparison, AutoCheck charges $24.99 for one or $49.99 for 25 reports in 21 days. \n\nWith those prices in mind, if you plan on casting a wide net and comparing many similar vehicles, Autocheck is clearly the more frugal option. However, if you just want to learn in-depth details about one specific vehicle, it may be worth spending a little extra for Carfax's extra features and data.\n\nAlthough they cost more, Carfax reports tend to be __highly detailed__ yet easier to understand, making them more user-friendly. Data such as mileage and the number of owners a vehicle has had are clearly labeled and neatly organized into sections. \n\n__Includes Service \u0026 Maintenance Records__\n\nFurthermore, Carfax is also the only report to show records such as maintenance dates, provided that the vehicle was serviced in a facility that shares this type of data, like the service department for a franchised dealership. This lets you see how well previous owners cared for the car, as well as any issues it may have had.\n\nCarfax receives data from over 100,000 sources, including every United States and Canadian provincial motor vehicle agency. Carfax also receives data from less common sources too, including auto auctions, police and fire departments, and collision repair shops. In North America alone, the Carfax database contains over 17.5 billion records.\n\nOf course, when it comes to vehicle data, quality matters too. Carfax reports provide a wide range of information, including information that you may not find on Autocheck reports.\n\n### Example Data You'll Find on Carfax\n\nHere are some examples of the type of data you'll find on a Carfax report:\n\n__Title Information__\n\nYou can discover if the car has a junk, flood, branded title or salvage title, or if it's ever been used as part of a commercial fleet. This provides insight into how the vehicle was used (and possibly abused), which helps to shed light on what you can expect from it in the future. After all, even if there's no structural damage, it's wise to learn about any wear and tear that may have taken its toll on the vehicle's many components.\n\n__Odometer Readings__\n\nCarfax also provides TIMA (Truth in Mileage Act)-certified odometer readings. This information lets you proceed with confidence, knowing that the odometer hasn't been fraudulently adjusted. \n\n__Lemons and Buybacks__\n\nIn the United States, Carfax reports also show lemon titles and manufacturer buybacks, helping you to avoid vehicles that have been problematic in the past. They also show where the vehicle was originally registered and used, giving you a better idea of the kind of conditions it has been exposed to.\n\n__Transfers of Ownership__\n\nCarfax reports also detail any transfers of ownership. After all, if the vehicle has had many owners, there's probably a reason. If the vehicle has a lien against it, your Carfax report will acknowledge it so you don't accidentally purchase property that technically doesn't belong to the seller due to outstanding debt. Carfax also lets you know if the vehicle is or has been stolen.\n\n__Inspections and Repairs__\n\nYou can also find information on when and where a car was inspected, including whether it passed or failed safety and emissions inspections. You can also learn about any maintenance records, repairs or other service history. If the vehicle has a consistent history of needing repairs, it may be prudent to look elsewhere. Carfax also lets you know if a vehicle has been recalled so you can make sure that any repairs or exchanges have already been completed.\n\n__Accidents__\n\nAdditionally, Carfax is guaranteed to have information about severe accidents, and Carfax offers the largest publicly accessible database of smaller accident reports that may not be reported elsewhere. That said, smaller accidents aren't guaranteed to show up on Carfax reports. Some accidents simply aren't reported, and others may be reported to agencies that don't provide Carfax with data.\n\n## AutoCheck\n\nAutoCheck is owned by Experian and it has relationships with industry leaders including CarMax (different than Carfax), eBay Motors, Edmunds.com, NADAguides.com, and Kelley Blue Book. This company __assigns each vehicle a numerical score__ (similar to a credit score for cars) within a range for similar examples of the same vehicle, age and mileage.\n\n__AutoCheck Score__\n\nThe score is intended to demonstrate how well the vehicle stacks up against other available cars in its class. This allows you to quickly weed out any vehicles with issues, which can be as benign as high mileage and repossessions or as serious as damage from one or more reported accidents. It will also let you know whether the car was ever used by police or taxi services.\n\nThese scores pay close attention to collision data, giving potential buyers a thorough look at what's happened (if anything) in the vehicle's past that might warrant concern.\n\nUnfortunately, the scale can be a little confusing, and how AutoCheck determines those numbers isn't particularly obvious. Those who prefer a highly detailed report may want to spend a little extra on Carfax reports. However, those who aren't as technically savvy may find that a simple numerical score streamlines the process and makes the information more easily digestible. It's largely a matter of preference.\n\n__Unique to AutoCheck: Auction Data__\n\nOne of AutoCheck's key advantages over Carfax is that it has exclusive access to auction data from the two largest United States auctions, giving prospective buyers a more comprehensive look at a vehicle's history (this is why their reports have a better reputation with used car dealers).\n\nFurthermore, AutoCheck lets their subscribers run up to 300 reports using VIN numbers (Vehicle Identification Number) from a desktop or tablet computer – or even a smartphone. As of this writing, Carfax did not offer any similar service.\n\nAutocheck provides much of the same information as Carfax, however __its database is not as large__. That said, some data available from Autocheck may not be available on Carfax too, so you may want to consider getting reports from both platforms just to be thorough.\n\n### Example Data You'll Find on AutoCheck:\n\nAutocheck provides registration and title data from all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia. The platform also delivers collision records from police reports and other sources, as well as event data from insurance companies and salvage yards.\n\n__Frequent Problem Area Checks__\n\nAutocheck checks for records of the vehicle being abandoned, damaged, junked or scrapped. Any major incidents reported to relevant databases are acknowledged. The platform also reports any documented fire, hail or water damage, as well as any frame or structural damage or odometer damage.\n\nThe platform also delivers any relevant records pertaining to the vehicle's relation with the grey market, recycling facilities or insurance loss or probable total loss. Autocheck delivers records of manufacturer buybacks or lemons, as well as reports on whether the vehicle is rebuilt or rebuildable. \n\n__NHTSA Data__\n\nAutocheck also provides any relevant NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) records that may be associated with the car, like branded title data. That way you can buy with confidence, knowing that your vehicle has passed safety standards.\n\n__Lower Cost__\n\nAs we mentioned, AutoCheck is cheaper than Carfax; a current single report is $24.99, 25 reports over 21 days is $49.99 and the 300-limit plan is $99.99. That's why many dealers use Autocheck. It's undoubtedly the more frugal option, however, the reports aren't as robust.\n\n## Which to Choose\n\nFirst of all, you may not need to decide. If you're buying through a dealer, broker or online service, it's likely that they will offer a report from one or both of these services. For example, Autolist often lists cars that come with free Carfax reports included. \n\nWhile Carfax reports are more expensive, we believe that potential buyers have the right to as much information as possible. Carfax reports simply offer more information, and when it comes to buying a used car, knowledge is power.\n\nBoth data sources do offer similar benefits, however. So, if you simply want to make sure that the car isn't stolen, for example, you may find choosing the cheaper option: Autocheck.\n\n__What Are Your Goals?__\n\nTo determine the best course of action, start by reviewing your goals. Do you want a highly detailed overview of the vehicle, or do you simply want to check to make sure the sale is legitimate?\n\nAre you spending a significant amount of money on a long-term daily driver, or are you simply getting the cheapest possible beater to get you from point A to B? Are you seeking a particular vehicle, or are you willing to take whatever fits your budget?\n\nThose who are making a serious investment would be wise to use Carfax or both platforms. The extra cost of Carfax gives you priceless peace of mind, knowing that you've used the most comprehensive option. Even if you're not actively seeking specific information, you may be surprised when new details show up that you didn't expect.\n\nAt the same time, Autocheck is still a very handy tool that may accomplish everything you need and more -- especially if you want a numerical Autocheck score that sums up the information for you. Just make sure that the information you're seeking is, in fact, covered by Autocheck's database.\n\nFinally, if you're browsing many different cars, it may make more sense to use Autocheck's 25 or 300-limit plan. That way you have the freedom to generate reports on any vehicle that sparks your interest, without having to dwell on the cost. After all, if you're spending some time finding that perfect ride, the cost of paying for each individual report adds up fast.\n\n## Both Reports Aren't Perfect\n\nWhile there's no denying that both Carfax and Autocheck reports are extremely useful, it's important to remember that both reports are limited to their databases, meaning that even the most detailed reports could be missing certain information.\n\nCarfax receives data from more organizations, so if there's an undisclosed issue with the vehicle, you're more likely to find it there. Additionally, Carfax does state that if there's a mistake on your vehicle history report, they will buy the vehicle back from you.\n\nHowever, even using both Carfax and Autocheck doesn't guarantee that you're going to discover every existing or potential issue. Some issues may have never been reported, or Carfax or Autocheck may not have access to certain information.\n\nThere's always going to be a certain amount of risk involved in buying used vehicles. The trick is to use tools like these to mitigate the risk. The odds are in your favor. After all, between both platforms, you have access to a tremendous amount of information. Just try not to depend on them as your only source of information.\n\nWhen it comes to learning about a car's history, it's wise to shop at reputable car lots and online platforms. You may be able to get a great deal buying through an independent seller, but there's more risk involved too.\n\nIf you do decide to buy from an independent dealer, communication is key. Spend some time researching the vehicle. Learn about common issues related to that specific model. Once you're armed with knowledge, you can ask the seller questions.\n\nOf course, there's no guarantee that a seller is going to be honest about the vehicle's history. At the same time, simply showing that you're an informed shopper is often enough to encourage sellers to be more transparent.\n\n## Start with Free Reports\n\nIn many cases you'll get one or both reports for free.  For example, here at Autolist, our platform gives you access to thousands of new and used car listings, as well as detailed information such as how long the car has been for sale and how its price compares to similar cars. That way you can make an informed decision on how to proceed.  In many cases dealers listing their vehicles on [Autolist](https://www.autolist.com) will provide a free Carfax report. \n\n__Free Carfax report example on Autolist:__\n\n![autolist-carfax-image](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1n6a7BUytGeuciu4iKqEm/1f49c7ee091ceb6d282fafd9a378feb3/autolist-carfax-image.jpg)\n\nIf you're shopping elsewhere and the seller doesn't offer a report and you're serious about buying a specific vehicle from them -- ask them to provide you one for free. Many sellers will provide one gladly; just make sure that you're genuinely interested in the vehicle, as the seller may have to pay for the report out of pocket.\n\nIf you're buying privately or the seller declines to make a report available, it's up to you if you want to spend the money. However, if the seller isn't willing to pay for the report, you may want to look elsewhere. \n\nAfter all, while there's nothing wrong with pinching pennies, a good seller recognizes a buyer's need for details. If they're not providing as many details as possible, there might be a reason. \n\nIf your dealer refuses to work with you to help you make an informed purchase, you may want to find a seller with a better reputation and a more buyer-friendly approach (especially if you're not well-versed int he automotive industry.\n\n## Get Both\n\nAt the end of the day, it never hurts to have as much information as possible. After all, even a relatively cheap used car is still a major purchase.\n\nWhen you look at the big picture, paying a little bit of extra money for these reports isn't going to make a big difference in your overall spending, and the information gained can go a long way in protecting your investment as a car buyer.\n\nWhen it comes down to Carfax vs. Autocheck, both companies enjoy excellent reputations in the industry and can provide you with important information. It's up to you to determine if an Autocheck report is enough to meet your needs, or if you prefer a more robust detailing of the vehicle in question.\n\nAutoCheck's 25 reports in 21 days plan can be an economical way to check the history of a variety of vehicles you're interested in. Autocheck vehicle history reports may not be as detailed, but if you only need basic information or a simple rating, often they're just fine.\n\nCarFax, meanwhile, gives you a great look at the service history of a vehicle so you have a keen sense of what work a car has had done and what work you might need to be prepared for. If you're buying a more expensive vehicle, or if you're just highly detail-oriented, a Carfax report may be ideal for you.\n\n### A Small Investment\n\nFor around $65, you're buying comprehensive peace of mind, which is a bargain for any vehicle. Research the vehicle independently beforehand, and only buy reports for cars that you're genuinely considering purchasing.

Answers range from the start of a new year to Christmas and the end of the year, including New Year's Eve. Fortunately, when it comes to shopping at car dealerships, you have plenty of opportunities to get a good deal on that Ford-F150, RAM 1500, or Toyota Tundra that makes your heart race.  \n\n__When Is the Best Time to Buy a Truck?__\n\nJust as it's true when shopping for a new car, there's no single answer to the question, \"When is the best time to buy a truck?\" If you need a new vehicle now, now is the best time, but if you have the luxury of extra time for car buying and truck shopping, your options are open. When hunting for a better deal, some of the best times to buy a truck are when car dealerships need to make their sales goals at the end of the month or meet their year-end sales quotas. Consider the last week of the month and the last week of the year when looking for a great time of year get your best price on a full-size truck. Cash-back incentives often expire at the end of a month or year, so catching those before they're gone helps you keep money in your wallet or bank account and get the truck you want.    \n\n__The Day of the Week Matters__\n\nNew vehicle dealerships are typically open six or seven days each week and the day you choose for truck buying makes a difference between a good deal and a better deal. The best time to buy a truck at a car dealership is typically Monday through Wednesday. Weekends get hectic because people who work during the week have time available to shop, and the lively media ads and promotions help attract more people, too. Sales and finance personnel are less busy early in the week, so they're more willing to spend time with you, answer your questions, and work a better deal. When you see those eye-catching advertisements created to draw you in on the weekend, think twice before you rush in to buy. However, certain weekends provide grand opportunities for bargains.  \n\n__Summer Holiday Weekends Are Good for Truck or Car Buying__\n\nMemorial Day is memorable when it's truck or car-buying time. This start-of-summer holiday gives truck and car buyers the jump on the swell of significant buying and deal-making. Car dealerships offer their best choices of closeouts on this holiday weekend. The Fourth of July is another holiday that's great for inventory featuring the current model year and incoming year's models, so you have a wide selection from which to choose. The Labor Day holiday weekend closes out the summer in many folks' minds, and car dealerships are looking to close out their current models to ensure room for the new model year vehicles. For buyers, it's a good time of the year to find a healthy selection of trucks and competitive dealer pricing. If you plan on holiday shopping, avoid some of the pressure of crowded showrooms and busy salespeople by visiting the car dealership on a less busy day to take your test drive. Go back to the showroom on the holiday, make your deal, and capture the added advertised savings.    \n\n__November's Black Friday Starts the Christmas Shopping Season__\n\nWell into autumn, Veterans Day offers an excellent opportunity to snag good deals on new and used trucks. Later in November, Black Friday gets retailers revved up for the Christmas holiday shopping season and car dealers are no different. Manufacturers' incentives to dealers and dealer discounts to buyers boost customer interest and help showroom owners meet their sales goals. Look for Black Friday savings on sticker prices of outgoing models as dealerships work to clear their inventory for the end of the year. Get a jump on the crowds and put your purchasing ducks in a row before the big day by determining how much you can afford and want to spend for a truck. Your credit union or bank should be happy to pre-approve an auto loan and estimate your monthly payments so that you can compare terms with the dealer's financing. If you're planning a trade-in, research your vehicle's current value and investigate whether selling it yourself gives you a better deal.      \n\n__December Might Be the Best Time of Year to Buy a Truck__\n\nDecember is the last month of the year, and the last chance truck manufacturers and sellers have to make their yearly sales goals. If Black Friday is the best day, December might be the best month for making sales quotas that shine. Salespeople and dealers striving for annual bonuses translate into better deals for you, especially if you have comprehensive information and sharp negotiating skills. When sellers want to close out this year on a higher note than last year, they price inventory to move out of the showroom and onto the street. Savvy buyers who know how to strike when the iron is hot can hammer out great deals. Data from TrueCar shows December is prime time for buying small or premium SUVs, such as the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, Toyota 4Runner, and Land Rover Range Rover Evoque.  \n\n__Buyers Rejoice From Christmas to the End of the Year__\n\nIf Santa didn't put that shiny new truck under your tree, take advantage of bargains during the last week and last day of the year. The week between Christmas and New Year's Eve and New Year's Day can mean ringing out the old and driving in the new with deep discounts on truck sticker prices. Vehicle buyers saved 8.3% on New Year's Eve and 8.5% on New Year's Day, according to TrueCar's data for 2015. If you don't want to miss your New Year's Eve party or parades and football games on the first day of the year, take comfort in knowing the auto industry calendar ends its December sales month on January 2 of the next year.  \n\n__The Worst Time to Buy a Truck__\n\nWith so many choices of the best time of year to buy a truck, you would think there couldn't be a worst time, but there is. Avoid making a deal for that new or used truck at the beginning of the month. Just as the end of the month is the best time because sellers want to make month-end deals, they have less incentive in the early part of the month to slash prices. Another poor choice is buying at the start of a model year. Dealers typically won't offer discounts for new models, but if you want a truck from the previous model year, you might be in luck.\n\nSimilarly, don't expect good deals on vehicles in high demand or when a newly designed model comes out. If you want one, plan to pay a premium price for it. What are some of the worst holidays to buy a truck? Mother's Day, Father's Day, and Easter Sunday. If dealers are open, their A-team staff members are not likely to be there.   \n\nWhether you desire or need a new or used one, the best time to buy a truck is whenever you find it. To play it smart, watch the calendar, come with vehicle research, have money in the bank or financing arrangements, and head for the dealership. Test drive, ask questions, and with your knowledge and skill, negotiate a better deal.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"ctaText":"Browse Trucks","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/pickup+truck","modified_date":"2019-04-12T18:24:26.209Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/iqGDl6u3QgMlFPcobvyMX/9cbb44fd3ae26aa96c364b496f10bc5f/cvt-automatic-transmission-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/lpyzySpERk6fm8KoOp5D7/3271c1aed7d7a89644ebd0167faf0650/cvt-automatic-transmission-325-image.jpg","slug":"cvt-vs-automatic-transmission","title":"CVT vs Automatic Transmission - Which is Better?","publication_date":"2019-04-11T09:10-08:00","content_summary":"Learn the differences, pros, and cons between a CVT vs. automatic transmission.

Why might you choose a CVT versus a conventional automatic transmission? \n\nSome drivers believe a CVT provides a smoother experience compared to a traditional automatic transmission or a manual transmission. But the biggest advantage is that they're more fuel efficient than a conventional automatic; this is why you've seen automakers put them in dozens of models in the past decade. \n\nCompare the pros and cons of a CVT vs. automatic type of transmission and make the better choice for your needs.\n\n__How a Manual vs. Automatic Transmissions Work__\n\nWhen you're driving a car with a manual transmission, such as a sports car or vintage vehicle, you use the stick shift on the car's console to maneuver between transmission gears, while simultaneously using your left foot to depress the clutch pedal. Gears are numbered from one to seven, plus a single reverse gear. As the engine's revolutions per minute (RPM) increase or decrease, you shift to the next higher gear or lower gear. This movement causes the car to accelerate or decelerate.\n\nYou work less when driving an automatic transmission car. The transmission shifts on its own; you simply select Park, Neutral, Reverse or Drive and the transmission does the rest. It matches the engine and road speeds automatically as you step on the gas.\n\nAutomakers build automatic gearboxes with a wide range of gears; older models have as few as three while more recently some brands have patented transmissions with 11. This allows the engine to generate the best turning force, or torque, within a range of speed. \n\nCars with conventional automatic transmissions have gained popularity over manual transmissions in the U.S. Automatic transmissions make learning to drive easier, require less attention when driving, and create less engine wear and tear.\n\n__How a CVT Works__\n\nUnlike conventional automatic transmissions, continuously variable transmissions don't have any gears. A CVT uses two cone-shaped pulleys. One pulley is connected to the engine and the other is connected to the rest of the transmission -- it delivers power to the wheels. A steel or composite belt connects the two pulleys. \n\nThe pulleys change widths depending on how much power the wheels need from the engine. As one pulley gets larger, the other gets smaller. This design enables a CVT-powered car to accelerate with strength and smoothness. \n\n__Vehicles Using CVTs__\n\nJapanese automakers use CTVs more than European and domestic car makers. Mitsubishi, Subaru, and Nissan were particularly early and eager adopters of CVTs and the brands feature them in most, if not all of their cars and SUVs, including the 2019 Nissan Altima and the Nissan Murano. Toyota and Honda now include CVTs in more models, including the 2019 Honda Civic and Honda Accord. Other CVT-equipped vehicles include Honda CR-V, Honda Accord, Nissan Rogue, and several Mitsubishi models. Domestic cars featuring CVTs include the 2011 Ford Fusion Hybrid. \n\nTo find out which type of transmission is in a particular car, check the automaker’s website or a printed vehicle brochure. If it's a new vehicle, look at the window sticker. Used cars may require more product review research.\n\n__Variations on CVTs__\n\nCVTs are not all the same. One variation is a different, less common CVT style using rollers and discs. \n\nBecause CVTs don't have any gears, they don't shift at the common times that an automatic will when the vehicle is accelerating. This lack of shift points can be unnerving for drivers and passengers used to the behavior of a common automatic. To combat this, many brands that rely on CVTs have programmed into their behavior artificial shift points that give drivers the feel of transmission shifting. \n\nThe 2019 Subaru Ascent SUV is one example (among many) that have this feature. The Ascent features eight preset shift points on the pulley system making it seem as if the car is shifting gears. Drivers either click on paddles mounted on the steering wheel or move the shift lever. \n\nOther models with CVTs have a conventional first gear like normal automatics and then a CVT handles the rest. \n\nCalled a “launch gear,\" this actual gear controls the car's initial acceleration; the transmission switches to the continuously variable transmission mode at 25 miles per hour. \n\nThe 2019 model year Toyota Corolla Hatchback has this setup and Toyota says it enables the car to achieve stronger and smoother acceleration from the start.\n\n__Pros of CVT vs Automatic Transmission__\n\nA key benefit of the CVT is its ability to change its gear ratio continuously as the engine speed changes. This means the engine is always operating at its peak efficiency. \n\nA CVT draws top engine power from a small engine, which gives drivers quicker acceleration than standard automatic transmissions.\n\nBecause of their greater ability to control the engine speed range, CVTs produce fewer emissions. CVTs are also lighter weight than traditional automatic transmissions. You get better fuel economy, especially in city driving.\n\nAs for the driving experience, some drivers comment that the CVT car ride is extremely smooth compared to normal automatic transmissions. They like that they notice RPM or engine speed changes only when the car is cruising or accelerating.\n\n__Cons of CVTs vs. Automatics__\n\nSome drivers miss the engine shifts and acceleration of the traditional automatic transmission experience. There's no sound or sense of running through the gears as with conventional automatic transmissions. Although the engine maintains its high speed, you hear only a humming or droning sound. Because a CVT may keep an engine running at higher RPM when an automatic would have shifted to a higher gear, CVT-equipped vehicles can make it seem like the engine is droning loudly under hard acceleration. \n\nServicing a CVT is different from servicing an automatic transmission. CVTs need special oil, transmission fluid, and parts. You have to take a CVT-equipped vehicle to a service department with a mechanic skilled in transmission repair and maintenance for this type of transmission. Owners of CVT-equipped vehicles find transmission repair is more expensive for them compared to automatic transmission repair or replacement.\n\nOther common problems CVT-equipped vehicle owners report include the occasional sudden loss of acceleration and overheating. Drivers complain of jerking, slipping, and shuddering. CVT belts can suffer excessive stretching and wear. Some owners have experienced transmission failure. Lawsuits against car makers claim the equipment performs unreliably.\n\nChoosing between a CVT vs. automatic is a matter of personal taste. You might prefer the road feel of the conventional automatic transmission. If maximum fuel economy matters, you might prefer the CVT. \n\nDo your research and above all else -- take a test drive to decide what's right for you.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Transmissions"],"ctaText":"Browse Listing","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-04-12T17:45:24.775Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1ONkTsYHvdela4OKMjdv9C/ac9713387d4398deee59997aed98010c/body-on-frame-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6N44AoBXf5fOZfcoTETUTD/f6273935329ed123071f46cf970a9b35/body-on-frame-325-image.jpg","slug":"body-on-frame","title":"What is Body on Frame?","publication_date":"2019-04-10T08:44-08:00","content_summary":"SUVs come in body-on-frame and unibody frame designs.

Underneath all those different models is one of two kinds of frames. Many newer SUVs are unibody vehicles. Most of these are based on passenger car designs. Traditional SUVs, as well as a few prominent current models, feature body-on-frame construction, as the first SUVs were closely related to pickup trucks of the time. This article discusses the differences between body on frame and unibody SUVs. It also highlights the benefits of body-on-frame SUVs for uses such as off-road driving and pulling heavy loads. Lastly, it looks at the benefits of unibody frames and why these frames have come to dominate the market.\n\n__What is Body-on-Frame Construction?__\n\nBody-on-frame design means the vehicle frame and body are two different pieces. Typically an existing pickup ladder frame is used as the base, with the body designed to fit the frame. Originally all vehicles were made using body-on-frame construction. From the 1930s onward it became primarily used on trucks. From their origins as military vehicles, SUVs were traditionally built using truck frames. That remained true until the late 1970s. From the 1980s onward manufactures shifted away from body-on-frame designs for passenger cars.\n\nThe number of body-on-frame SUVs is only a fraction of the total SUV market, with only about 15 model lines available. Most of these are larger SUVs, such as the American made vehicles from Ford and General Motors. GM makes the Cadillac Escalade, Chevy Suburban, Tahoe and GMC Yukon using the Silverado pickup truck frame. Ford produces the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator using the F-150 frame. The upcoming 2021 Bronco is based on the Ford Ranger frame design, as are the internationally sold Everest and older Ford Explorers. The Jeep Wrangler features body-on-frame construction.\n\nToyota is a major automaker outside the United States that has body-on-frame designs. Here, it offers models such as the Toyota 4Runner, Sequoia and Land Cruiser, as well as Lexus GX and LX models. Mercedes G-Class SUVs are body-on-frame, as is the Nissan Armada and its companion Infiniti QX80.\n\n__What is Unibody Construction?__\n\nAs the name suggests, unibody frames, are made with the frame and body combined into one piece. Unibody design SUVs are typically modified forms of passenger car unibody frames. Unibody frames were first used on a large scale in passenger cars starting in the 1930s and, by the 1970s, increasingly became the standard for refinement, quality and safety standards.\n\nThe first SUVs with unibody construction appeared in the 1980s, with the 1984 Jeep Cherokee is a notable example. The 1996 Toyota RAV4 was a first in that it was built off of a platform used for a sedan. By 2006 more than half of the SUVs manufactured had unibody construction. Today's SUVs, whether they have off-road pretentions or not, are predominantly constructed with unibody designs, including models from Jeep and Land Rover, as well as Acura and Volkswagen. Even the Honda Ridgeline pickup uses a unibody structure from the Pilot SUV.\n\nFuel economy and a smoother ride have been the dominant reasons why unibody SUVs have overtaken body-on-frame designs. The first unibody models appeared after the fuel shortages of the 1970s. SUVs as an entire class became a prominent vehicle in North America through the 1990s and 2000s. This rise coincided with regulations requiring better fuel economy in vehicles, which favors the lighter unibody frames.\n\nAdditionally, driver use of SUVs changed as the vehicles dominated the market. For many drivers, the ability to load the cargo area with groceries, pets or kids' gear—not off-roading capabilities or hauling capacity—was the primary reason for buying an SUV. That helped smoother handling and greater fuel economy become higher priorities in the SUV market.\n\n##What are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Body-on-Frame Construction?##\nThe primary benefit of this type of construction is resistance to torque and twisting compared to unibody vehicles. That makes these vehicles well suited for off-roading and transporting heavy loads. Off-roaders typically can drive over rougher terrain in a body-on-frame vehicle.\n\nBody-on-frame vehicles are also typically less expensive to manufacture. This is in part because manufacturers can mount different bodies on the same frames. Body-on-frame vehicles can also be cheaper to repair after collisions. The separate body and frame can allow mechanics greater access to damaged parts. Alternately, a severely damaged structure or body can be replaced in its entirety if one or the other remains intact.\n\nThe main disadvantage of body-on-frame construction is that it increases the weight of vehicles. That leads to reduced fuel economy. Body-on-frame vehicles also tend to have poorer handling and cornering than unibody vehicles. In general, the ride in body-on-frame SUVs is not as smooth as passenger cars or crossover SUVs.\n\n__What are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Unibody Construction?__\n\nUnibody construction gives SUVs greater handling and cornering for a smoother ride and allows them to be tuned to drive more like passenger cars. These SUVs are also lighter in weight, which results in better fuel economy. Additionally, as a majority of models are built on unibody frames, there are more choices for SUV buyers.\n\nThe primary drawbacks of unibody design are reduced off-roading ability. That is because the single frame does not handle twisting forces as well. Likewise, unibody vehicles may have less hauling and towing capacity than body-on-frame SUVs. Lastly, unibody SUVs can be more expensive to produce and repair.\n\n__Summary__\n\nSUVs come in both body-on-frame and unibody frame designs. Body-on-frame models feature a separate frame and body. The frame is typically used as the base for pickup trucks as well as SUVs. Unibody frame models combine the body and frame into one piece. This design mimics passenger cars.\n\nBody-on-frame construction is better at resisting twisting forces. It is better for off-road driving and hauling heavy loads. Unibody frame construction results in a lighter vehicle, usually resulting in better fuel economy, handling, and cornering.\n\nIn general body-on-frame SUVs are best for buyers planning to drive off-road or frequently haul loads. Otherwise, the smoother driving and better gas mileage of unibody SUVs typically outweigh the benefits of body-on-frame construction. Drivers that use their SUV for a mix of activities must weigh better on-road handling and fuel economy versus better off-road handling and hauling ability.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Definitions"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-04-12T17:59:57.889Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6svMxcNzdfYDre9rqjh2R1/8dca718049be3bd60758e8994e7753c4/cheapest-states-buy-car-1166-image-c.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7AIG1DzwH4J6UmHRMhoMZA/a85ef944c9d1a1d44d7ec1efc0be3f24/cheapest-states-buy-car-325-image.jpg","slug":"cheapest-state-to-buy-used-car","title":"Cheapest State to Buy a Used Car","publication_date":"2019-04-09T10:27-08:00","content_summary":"The cost of buying and maintaining a car can vary from state to state.

It can be significantly less expensive to own a car in certain states, such as Florida or New Hampshire, than in more expensive states like California or New York. \n\nSome of the cheapest states to buy a used car and own a car are Florida, Oregon, New Hampshire, Virginia, Ohio, Wisconsin, Missouri and North Carolina. Here's a look at why.\n\n__Best State Based on Initial Cost of a Used Car: Florida__\nOne of the first things to consider when purchasing a new car is the initial cost. The price of a new or used car is not standard across all states so shopping around and know the facts can be beneficial. When looking for a used car, Florida has some of the cheapest options available.  As of 2016, used vehicles cost almost 10 percent less in Florida than they do nationwide. With an older population, more drivers sell their vehicles than in other states so there are more opportunities to purchase used cars at a more affordable price. Wealthier residents in areas like Miami also sell their vehicles more frequently so it is a buyers' market for several reasons in Florida. Plus, most of these vehicles have never seen snowy conditions and the salt used to melt the snow, so they are often in great condition. \n\n__Best State Based on Unexpected Fees: Oregon__\nInitial cost is not the only factor to consider when purchasing a new car. There are multiple fees to keep in mind when purchasing a car and they can really add up. The initial fees that come into play when first buying a car will only run you up to a maximum of $130 in Oregon as of 2018, which is significantly cheaper than most other states. \n\nThose who reside in Alaska and New Hampshire also do not have to worry about exorbitant fees. The maximum in those states is only approximately $360. This compares to some of the more expensive states which can cost up to $2,350. Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, and Tennessee have some of the highest fees in this regard.\n\n### Best States to Own a Car\nThe sticker price of the car and the associated fees are not the only thing to keep in mind when buying a new car. There are several maintenance and insurance fees to consider as well.\n\n__New Hampshire__\nNew Hampshire has some of the most affordable fees. As of 2016, the one-time initial fee associated with the purchase is just $25. The average annual cost of ownership and using a car in New Hampshire, including auto insurance and gas costs, is $2,691. \n\nOne of the great things about getting a car in New Hampshire is that there is no sales tax for vehicle purchases which can save you a lot of money upfront. Only four other states have no sales tax on vehicle purchases: Oregon, Delaware, Montana and Alaska. \n\nInsurance premiums are quite low in New Hampshire as well, coming in at approximately $941 annually in 2016, and an average of $337 a year for the cost of repairs.\n\n__Missouri__\nThe initial purchase fees are not particularly inexpensive in Missouri, but the state does have some of the cheapest gas prices in the U.S. which lowers overall ownership and transportation costs. \n\nIn general, Missouri residents pay less than the average American for the majority of car-related expenses including registration and title fees, as well as auto insurance and costs associated with upkeep and maintenance.\n\n__North Carolina__\nAs of 2016, North Carolina has a car sales tax of 3 percent, which is lower than most other states. Insurance is relatively inexpensive in this state as are registration and title fees. \n\nNorth Carolina is also an affordable place to buy and insure a new vehicle, but it is important to keep in mind that maintenance costs are particularly high so upkeep can cost you.\n\n__Wisconsin__\nCar ownership is particularly inexpensive in Wisconsin. With lower insurance premiums, car maintenance fees, and gas prices, Wisconsin has the second-lowest car ownership costs in the United States as of 2016. One-time purchase fees are higher in Wisconsin than in Missouri and North Carolina, but the lower ownership fees can offset this overall cost.\n\n__Ohio__\nAs of 2016, the Ohio sales tax rate for cars is 5.75 percent. That's a bit higher than some of the other states on the list and can raise initial and overall costs. But the sales tax may be offset by the lower insurance premiums in Ohio, which are the second-lowest out of all 50 states, in addition to lower gas prices and car maintenance fees.\n\n__Virginia__\nVirginia does have some of the most expensive repair costs in the country so maintaining a vehicle can cost owners a significant amount of money. However, auto insurance premiums and gas prices are relatively inexpensive when compared with other states. The initial purchasing fees, including registration and title fees, are also cheaper in Virginia than in Ohio.\n\n### Shopping Around\nIt's important to realize that car prices can fluctuate and certain models of cars may be less expensive in some states for a variety of reasons. Knowing the make and model of the car you want can offer more opportunities for savings. \n\nFor example, listing prices on Honda CR-Vs tend to be much cheaper in Maine and Delaware than in other states, while a Toyota Camry tends to be particularly inexpensive in Kentucky (probably because they're built there). \n\nThe best deals on a Ford F-150 are often found in Missouri or Rhode Island. \n\nAlthough shopping in different states for lower prices can help save money, keep in mind that states have different registration fees and sales tax that can drive up the cost. Remember to factor long-term maintenance costs into your car budget as well!\n\n### Overall Winner: New Hampshire\nThe overall cheapest state to buy a car in is New Hampshire due to the lack of sales tax and the low registration fees. \n\nFlorida is a close second thanks to a wide variety of used-car inventory and because used cars can cost almost 10 percent less than the national average. Just remember: there is still a 6 percent sales tax on car purchases and much larger registration and title fees.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Affordable","States"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-04-30T18:14:18.298Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5A7Q2fwXsCzYmchRia69lh/2c469bfe9d5e8549b49718cc8676fbb9/invoice-price-for-cars-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6XUXpn0kAREegfZKchqOLZ/58e6e696bfe171788edbe46c63aaa777/invoice-price-for-cars-325-image.jpg","slug":"invoice-price","title":"Invoice Price for Cars - Can You Go Lower?","publication_date":"2019-04-08T09:39-08:00","content_summary":"Find out what exactly the dealer invoice price is and whether you can expect to pay less or more when you go to buy a new car.","parent_page":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides","slug":"guides"},"categories":[{"name":"Buying Guides","description":"Guides that help buyers with their automotive purchase.","parentCategory":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides"}}],"category":{"name":"Buying Guides","description":"Guides that help buyers with their automotive purchase.","parentCategory":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides"}},"author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"body":"If you're in the market for a new car, you've probably heard terms like the 'invoice price,' 'sticker price,' 'MSRP' and 'dealer invoice.' \n\nBut it's often hard to tell the price where you should start your negotiations and the one you should aim to pay.\n\nThe dealer invoice price is sometimes shown to car buyers to show what the car dealer supposedly paid for the vehicle. The idea is to say that they won't make a profit if they sell it for lower. However, the truth is that dealers very often pay a lot less than the so-called dealer cost that they show car buyers. \n\nSo, can you go lower than the shown dealer invoice price? Absolutely.\n\n__Where To Negotiate__\n\nKeep in mind the following terms when deciding where to negotiate on a particular car:\n\n- Sticker price (MSRP)\n\n- Invoice price\n\n- True Market Value (TMV)\n\n- Kelley Blue Book Price (KBB)\n\nThe dealer wants you to start at MSRP, but you should aim for the invoice price while keeping the TMV price in mind. The latter price is essentially what other car buyers in your area are paying for the car you want. Generally, that number will be less than MSRP, but more than invoice. \n\nRemember though that it's an average and some buyers will pay more or less. Keep that number in mind as one you can expect to pay, but work on getting below it. \n\nThe last price is the KBB price. Not only can you look up new-car pricing via KBB, but this is also how you'll determine the value of your trade-in (if applicable). It's a good idea to negotiate your trade-in last and separately from the new car price. One tactic is to give you money off the new car, but then short you on your trade-in.\n\n__Digging Deeper Into Dealer Invoice Prices__\n\nCar buyers are often told to start negotiating at the MSRP, which is often called the sticker price. This stands for Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price and it is essentially the price that car dealers want you to pay for the car. It doesn't mean that's what the car is worth or the only price where they make a profit. \n\nBut when you're car shopping, you should be aiming for the price known as 'dealer invoice'. As previously mentioned, this is generally unlikely to be the real price that the dealer paid for the car, but more what they want you to *think* they paid for the car. The cost of the vehicle at this point is usually anywhere from several hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars below the sticker price. Similar to how MSRP is what the dealer wants you to pay, the factory invoice price is what automakers want the dealer to pay. In the end, neither number really matters in the market reality of car pricing.\n\n__What Is the Actual Cost of a Given Car?__\n\nUnfortunately, it's almost impossible to answer this question. The true cost of a vehicle varies, plus, the dealer's cost is a closely-guarded secret and often involves incentives and or bonuses to the dealer from the manufacturer for hitting various sales quotas. \n\nWhen a car first hits the market and/or it's extremely popular, dealers will be firm on MSRP as a new car price, and they may even charge more. Due to the popularity, anyone car shopping for that particular vehicle will have a hard time getting close to invoice cost because there's likely someone right behind them ready to pay the full price. \n\nEventually though, as the initial high demand is met, car shoppers don't want to pay MSRP and dealers won't be paying full invoice to the automaker. Regardless, the dealer will almost never tell you exactly how much they really paid for a particular car. Even if they show you the dealer invoice price, it is unlikely that it's the price they actually paid.\n\n__What Are Dealer Rebates?__\n\nConsumer cash back or cash rebates are offered by manufacturers to buyers and it's one of the best ways to save money on buying a new car. Manufacturers may also offer cash back to the dealer itself on some vehicles. You might be able to spot where this is happening if you're directed to a different vehicle than the one you came in for. They're very likely getting a big rebate if they sell the car they're pointing you to.\n\n__What About Dealer Incentives?__\n\nYou may have heard that shopping for a new vehicle at the end of a month, quarter or year is a good idea. The reason why is because dealers get cash incentives by hitting sales goals at the end of the aforementioned periods. For example, suppose a dealer can get an additional $200 per vehicle if they sell over 250 vehicles in a month. If they're on the last day of the month and they have 245 vehicles sold, it's a pretty easy choice to knock some money off your car if it will help them make a bonus of $50,000. Of course, the caveat with this advice is that you have no real way of knowing before you go to the car lot if a particular dealer has met their sales goals for a period. However, if they seem pretty willing to take money off the price, chances are they haven't.\n\n__Where Dealers Profit__\n\nBelieve it or not, that new car price is not where dealers are making most of their money. Instead, financing and add-ons that the car dealership itself sells make them a bigger profit. They also tend to make a bigger profit on used cars versus new cars. \n\nDealers' service centers are also a much larger source of profits than new car sales. \n\nFor the other categories, dealers make a profit through a commission of up to three percent on the total loan amount they secure for an outside lender. They can also mark up the interest rate to you from what they were quoted and then pocket the profit. \n\nThey also tend to make a lot of profit on add-ons like extended warranties, window etching, key protection and roof racks among others. They may also include a variety of fees that are nothing but profit for them.\n\n__What To Remember__\n\nIt's still important to remember that buying a car is still a business transaction. Even though you want to save the most money and get a great deal, the car dealership should still expect to get some profit. They still have to pay their employers, keep their inventory, pay advertising fees and keep the lights on. In the end, you will never know the exact factory invoice price and despite what the salesperson says, they likely don't know either. \n\nBut if you walk into the dealership with the information above, you'll likely walk out with a much better deal.

And it's essential to your social life and helping your family. If your old car has seen better days, you might be curious about how to save up for a car. \n\nWhether you want to buy a new car or a used car, you may need to save up money for a down payment or even the entire purchase price. Here are a few tips to help you budget and save money for the car you need to get you where you need to go. \n\n__Decide How Much You Want to Spend__\n\nThe first thing you need to do is decide how much you want to spend on a used or new car. If you think you can make monthly payments, it's beneficial to decide how much your monthly car payment can be and still afford your other bills. Don't forget that you need to pay sales tax when you buy the vehicles, regardless of whether it's new or used.\n\nOnce you know how much monthly payment you can afford, it's time to decide on the down payment amount. For example, if you can afford a $300 a month and you want a car that costs $20,000, you're going to need a hefty down payment to get the payment to down to $300 per month. \n\nIf you have a trade-in, you can figure that into your calculations. Just remember that you'll make more on that vehicle if you sell it privately than you will if you trade it in to a dealer.\n\nThe cost of the car may also increase and decrease based on the interest rate you qualify for on a car loan. \n\nWhen you're in the planning stages of buying your next vehicle, it's a good idea to check your credit score to get an idea of your interest rate when approved for an auto loan. If you can, make improvements to your credit score. This can save money over the period of the car loan. \n\n__Consider Other Expenses for Your First Car__\n\nRemember owning a new or used car costs more than just the monthly payments. You also need to budget for costs such as gasoline, maintenance, repairs, car insurance, tags, and yearly taxes. You need to ensure that your budget not only covers your expense but provides additional funds for savings and things you want to do or buy. \n\nMost experts encourage you to budget. This means that 50 percent of your monthly income goes to necessities — rent, utilities, food, insurance, car payments — while 30 percent goes to your wants and the remaining 20 percent is put into savings. \n\nCar insurance can cost more for the first six months if this is your first car and first time buying car insurance. Fortunately, there are ways to save a little on your premiums. If you have homeowners or renters insurance through the same agency, they'll often give you a bundle discount. \n\nDid you take driver's education in high school? If so, make sure the agent knows this and see if you qualify for a discount on your insurance costs. If you pay cash for your car and don't owe anything on it, you can buy just basic car insurance. However, as part of your car loan, you probably need to have full coverage, which costs more than a basic insurance policy. \n\n__Have a Savings Plan__\n\nThese days, you probably don't keep cash in envelopes for various bills. But do you have a savings account? It's a good idea to open a new bank account as part of your budgeting process for a new car. If you qualify for one, a credit union is always a good option for both a checking account and savings account, since most don't charge service fees or require a minimum balance. \n\nOpening a savings account dedicated to saving for your new car should be the first step in your savings plan. It provides you with an account where you can stash your cash and not mix it with money you need for essentials and wants. A savings account can also add a little extra money in the form of interest payments. As part of your monthly budget, it's beneficial to assign a minimum amount to transfer to the new savings account. You can even make it automatic. \n\n__Save Automatically__\n\nIf you already have already set up direct deposit to your checking account, you can arrange to move part of your salary automatically to your savings account. You can watch this account grow and more easily project when you're going to be ready to review your financing options.  But how much should you assign to this account?\n\nIf you've already determined how much you can afford in monthly payments and the cost of car-related expenses, then that's the amount you can aim to put in savings each month. \n\nOf course, you need to consider the expenses for your current car if you're already a car owner. You want the amount automatically moved to your savings account to be realistic so you don't get in the habit of dipping into the account and keep your car fund growing.\n\n__Cut Your Expenses__\n\nAre you wasting a lot of money on your \"wants\" instead of saving up for the type of car that you want? It's time to take a good look at where your money goes and where you can make cuts. Some common areas to cut costs include:\n\n-Eating out\n-Coffee runs\n-Groceries\n-Entertainment\n-Clothing\n-and much more!\n\nIt might be time to consider cooking yourself dinner and enjoying a rented movie at home instead of going out and seeing one in the theater. There are many ways to save money. You can clip coupons and join saving programs at your favorite stores. Many times, a few small changes can make a big difference in your personal finance. \n\nFor instance, check the sales circular at your local grocery store and plan your weekly meals based on the items on sale. You don't want to pay full price for food items when you can opt to eat well and save money at the same time. Look at your cable plan and see if there are some channels you can live without if you opt for a less expensive plan. \n\nTo start cutting expenses and purchasing your next car, consider starting a journal and documenting where all your money goes -- or find one of the many apps that will track your spending for you. From a quick coffee run to Starbuck to a bag of chips at a vending machine, document where you spend money. After a few days, it becomes clear where you can cut back on expenses. \n\n__Get a Part-time Job or Side Gig__\n\nWhen you need more money, you have two choices, make more money or spend less. It's beneficial for your budgeting to buy a new car to do both at once. You can check Craigslist for part-time work or contractor work. Many of these side hustles allow you to work on your own schedule. If you have a recent car in good shape, try applying for work with Uber or Lyft. Another way to make cash quickly is by delivering food for a pizza joint or Chinese restaurant. \n\nIf you're a writer, you can consider working online in your spare time. There are many ways to earn a little extra cash online but do your research and make sure that you use reputable services that pay on time and for the work you do. You can even upload your grocery store receipts for a little extra money. \n\n__Continue Making Car Payments__\n\nDid you recently pay off a car? Well, instead of using that extra money to buy new shoes or to go to a concert, move your old car payment amount into your savings account and earmark it for your next vehicle. Since your budget already reflects that payment, you won't feel like you're missing out on anything.\n\nIt's amazing how fast that money grows. For example, if you've been paying $400 a month on your recently paid off account, place the monthly payment in a savings plan, and in 10 months, you have $4,000 to buy a used car or make a down payment on another vehicle. If you don't have a pressing need for a new car, then this method helps you make great strides saving for your next vehicle and saves you money in interest payments over the long run. \n\n__Clean up Your Credit Score__\n\nIf you know that you need financing for your next vehicle, you want to clean up your credit as part of the savings plan. Several online websites allow you to run your credit for free. After seeing your score and accounts, you can concentrate on paying off a credit card or disputing a problem with your credit accounts. The better your credit score means the better the interest rate you receive when you go to finance your new car. This can help you lower the down payment needed and lower your monthly payments. With a better credit score, you might be able to purchase your new car with less money up front. \n\n__Set a Goal__\n\nFor most people, it isn't enough to say that they're going to save money. Decide on the amount of money you want to save for your new car and the timeframe you want to buy the car within. For instance, set the goal to save up a 20 percent downpayment of $6,000 for a new car within six months. This means that you must save $1,000 each month. Once you have a goal established, set benchmarks.\n\nYou can treat yourself to an afternoon golfing or a new bag when you hit the 25 percent mark. This helps to keep you motivated, and you're less likely to feel like you're missing out on something. At the start of each month, review your goals and see if you're on track to meet it. If you feel overwhelmed saving so much each month, adjust your goals and change your timeframe as needed. In some cases, you may find that you've saved more than you planned to and can make a purchase sooner.\n\n__Sell Your Car or Trade it in__\n\nWhen you're close to reaching your savings goal, it's time to consider what to do with your current vehicle. If you don't need a second vehicle, you need to either sell it yourself or trade it in at the dealership. It's always less hassle for you to trade it in at the dealership but you might be losing some money in the process. Of course, it's possible to get the dealership to offer better finance options with an included trade in. \n\nWith the internet at almost everyone's fingertips, selling a car yourself has never been easier. From Facebook and CarFax to Craigslist and online yard sales, there is always a place to put your current vehicle online in just a few clicks and uploaded photos. You can even use your email instead of providing a phone number so your phone doesn't ring off the hook. This makes it easier than calling up a newspaper and placing an ad like the old days. Take your time and explore both options to see which helps you reach the goal of a new car more quickly. \n\nWhen the time grows closer to buying a new or used car, use these tips for how to budget for a car to help you accomplish your goals and get behind the wheel of the car of your dreams sooner. Setting goals and opening a savings account can help keep you focused on saving. With a few budget cuts, you can save more effectively and cut the time you need to wait before making a purchase. A side hustle helps build your savings and makes the time pass quicker. Taking care of your credit score is essential for securing the best financing and interest rates possible. Following this guide for how to save up for a car can aid you in purchasing your next vehicle.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Budgeting"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com","modified_date":"2019-04-05T23:50:43.047Z"}],"reviewsArticleSummaries":[{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6DEmVcOI6CAR4nr9HzJmFq/c185f5701906a72e4b42df467ae95b4a/2019-audi-q7-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4QXvJ7ugOBgRn8aMlSUtfn/a9ac21eed7efce360fe910dbdfef76b5/2019-audi-q7-325-image.jpg","slug":"2019-audi-q7-review","title":"2019 Audi Q7 Review","publication_date":"2019-05-27T13:56-08:00","content_summary":"2019 Q7 Review 3.0 liter Supercharged V6 Virtual Cockpit Digital Instrument Cluster Four-wheel steering Adaptive Air Suspension LED Headlights Bang \u0026 Olufsen Bose 3D ","parent_page":{"name":"Audi Q7","description":"Audi Q7","slug":"audi-q7"},"categories":[{"name":"Car Review","description":"Autolist Car Review","parentCategory":{"name":"Reviews","description":"Reviews"}}],"category":{"name":"Car Review","description":"Autolist Car Review","parentCategory":{"name":"Reviews","description":"Reviews"}},"author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"body":"### Summary\n\nThe 2019 Audi Q7 is a German midsize three-row luxury SUV/Crossover, its in a class with the [Mercedes-Benz GLE](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes-benz), [BMW](https://www.autolist.com/bmw) X7, [Lincoln Aviator](https://www.autolist.com/lincoln-aviator), [Volvo XC90](https://www.autolist.com/volvo-xc90), [Infiniti QX60](https://www.autolist.com/infiniti-qx60) and the [Acura MDX](https://www.autolist.com/acura-mdx). This SUV sits higher on the Audi SUV totem pole as only the Q8 and the electric e-tron model outrank the Q7. This model appeals to new car buyers interested in a luxury SUV/Crossover with three rows of seats, capable of seating up to seven passengers, two powertrain options and high quality interior design.\n\nThe 2019 Q7 is the part of the second Q7 generation introduced back in late 2016. This year navigation is standard on every new Q7. Also new on the Premium Plus trim for the 2019 model year is Audi's Virtual Cockpit digital gauge cluster, 360-degree top-view camera system, wireless phone charging and LED Headlights all standard. Another new for 2019 is all-season run-flat-tires for the optional 20-inch wheel package.  \n\nThe Q7 is available in three different trim levels, Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige. The base model price begins at $54,545 while the Prestige trim model starts at $69,695, this includes the destination fee before adding options and packages.  \n\n### Exterior\n\nThe Q7 is a large SUV/Crossover however the Q7's design absolutely meshes with Audi trademark styling. It is definitely not as large as some of its competitors and benefits from a lower roof line making loading or removing from the available roof rails easier. \n\n![2019-audi-q7-exterior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/14wgILj0SIBFRaikGRGLgk/6bc83cb1582e408e67fca577e22269a7/2019-audi-q7-exterior1.jpg)\n\nThe large aggressive Single frame grille stands out in the styling department yet maintains its classic Audi appearance. This design is subtle and conservative and does a great job of disguising its large presence. \n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort\n\nThe standard interior of the Q7 is leather, Audi also offers Valcona leather seats and Alcantara headliner available in the Luxury package option. Other standard features include a panoramic sunroof with shade, power tilt and silde. While minimalist the style and build quality of the this top-notch interior is attractive, practically in a class of its own and in some cases better than the much more expensive competition.\n\n![2019-audi-q7-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/14ks9FyADzLzKHzWj562jT/9cd777f28810e0f57fed6cf43d6aeee3/2019-audi-q7-interior2.jpg)\n\nEvery button and knob controls are all well within reach of the driver while the 3-spoke steering wheel has easily legible controls. The MMI all-in-touch pad allows drivers to write entries into the system rather than scrolling through letters. The heads up display while only available on the Prestige trim model projects customizable driving information and warnings  on to the windshield. All the controls and buttons which have haptic feedback really add to the high-end feel of this interior. \n\nSeating on Audi's Flagship SUV/Crossover is just as comfortable as the A8 if not better. The second row seats are as comfortable for adults as the front, however the third row is much more suitable for smaller passengers and could easily be designated for children only. Heated front seats are standard on all Q7's while heated rear seats are optional. The Premium Plus trim level offers ventilated front seats optional. The Prestige trim offers contour front seats with ventilation and a massage feature. \n\nAll rear five seats of the Q7 are equipped with easily to access LATCH anchors.\n\n### Utility and Practicality \n\nThe cargo space in the Q7 is limited as is expected with a luxury SUV/Crossover with third row seating. Powered 50/50 third row seats folded and the 35/30/35 second row seats folded flat the Q7 allows for 71.6 cubic feet of cargo space. With both the second and third row seats in use the rear cargo space shrinks to 14.8 cubic feet, this space is below the class average. The programable power hands-free tailgate is standard on the base model and the lower floor height make for easy loading and unloading. \n\n![2019-audi-q7-exterior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/61mB4zQdcF0YYXt1RXBYpW/9d5652b644fbdb72c3ac24247eac9ebf/2019-audi-q7-exterior2.jpg)\n\nTowing capabilities vary on the Q7 depending on which powertrain option you choose. The 2.0 liter turbo four cylinder engine is capable of towing 4,400 pounds. The 3.0 liter supercharged V6 engine is capable of towing 7,700 pounds. \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Technology and Infotainment\n\nThe Q7 has a high-tech feel and is loaded with cool standard features like the MMI all-in-touch interface, which will easily be in the running for the most user-friendly inerfaces. It enables the user to draw the entries on a touch-pad rather than scrolling back and forth through the alphabet as most vehicle interfaces require. The main screen which sits on top of the dashboard is 8.3 inches. \n\n![2019-audi-q7-interior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/RrB1s8acSCCtoNgmuSsSQ/7db1fc826cc903f81328b20737a4faa1/2019-audi-q7-interior1.jpg)\n\nAudi Virtual Cockpit available on the Premium Plus trim level is not your traditional instrument cluster, it is an upgraded 12.3-inch digital screen which can display a standard classic instrument panel with tachometer and speedometer, or a custom layout designed by the owner which can display full screen navigation, turn-by-turn direction and all other infotainment options with a minimized tach and speeometer. Navigation is standard on all Q7's but only with the Virtual Cockpit can you access and view navigation, audio, google earth imagery and phone options on the fully customizable instrument gauge cluster. \n\nStandard on all Q7's is Audi Smart Phone Interface with Apple CarPlay and Google's Android Auto which enables access to your smartphone navigation, select third-party applications which can be controlled via the MMI interface, voice control system or steering wheel controls. \n\nWith a subscription you can equip your Q7 with Google earth imagery, traffic info and weather conditions. New owners receive a 6-month trial of Audi Connect PRIME, Wi-Fi hotspot and in-vehicle 4G LTE.\n\nThe Q7 base model includes a 10-speaker audio system with a single disc CD player and MP3 playback. The Premium Plus trim upgrades the sound system to a BOSE 19-speaker 3D Surround Sound, 15-channel amp and 558 watts of power. Optional only on the Prestige trim is a 3D advanced sound system with 23-speakers, 23-channel BeoCore amp with 1,920 watts by Bang \u0026 Olufsen.\n\n### Safety and Driving Assistance\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) gave the Q7 good markings in every category, headlights received a marginal rating for but specifies only on certain trims/options. In the department of crash avoidance and mitigation specifically front crash prevention the IIHS gave the Q7 a superior rating. This is largely in part to Audi equipping all Q7's with Audi pre sense front and pre sense basic. This enables the Q7 to recognize vehicles and pedestrians in front of the vehicle and initiate emergency braking.  \n\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website the Audi Q7 received overall 5 stars out of 5 stars. In frontal crash the Q7 received 4 out of 5 stars. In side crash rating the Q7 received 5 out of 5 stars. In the rollover rating the Q7 received a 4 out of 5 stars. \n\nAs mentioned before the Q7 comes standard with Audi pre sense front which can detect vehicles at speeds up to 52 mph, the system will warn the driver of collision and begin emergency braking, this system can also stop the vehicle st speeds under 25 mph. \n\nAudi pre sense basic does the work to minimize damage during a collision by beginning to close the widows and sunroof as well as begin to pre-tension the front seat belts. On Q7 Premium Plus trim models Audi pre sense rear is standard, this technology monitors and calculates the distance of following vehicles. If an imminent collision is detected, just like pre sense basic, the Q7 will initiate a collision warning and begin to close windows and sunroof while also activating pre-tensioning of the front seat belts. \n\nThe Q7 is equipped with several standard and optional driver assistance safety features such as Audi active lane assist, which uses a camera mounted in front of the rear view mirror, the camera and its system monitors lane markings and can vibrate the steering wheel gently if the system notices the vehicle is nearing the edge of the lane without using the turn signal. \n\nCollision avoidance assist helps the driver by providing steering guidance during sharp avoidance maneuvers to avoid a potential accident. Rear cross traffic assist monitors the sides and the rear of the vehicle while reversing out of a parking space, if it detects a possible collision it can issue a warning tone and a brake jolt to alert the driver to stop the vehicle. \n\nTurn assist constantly monitors front traffic using radar sensors. The system can intervene if the driver attempts to cross traffic at a low speed and detects there is a hazard. \n\nAudi adaptive cruise control with traffic jam assist allows the driver to set a preset distance from the vehicle in front and will apply the brake and accelerate to maintain the preset distance. \n\nNight vision assist uses infrared and thermal technology to see further down the road in low-light conditions up to 300 ft. \n\nAudi park steering assist uses ultrasonic sensors all around the vehicle, all that is needed from the driver is to apply the brake and or accelerate when necessary. \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Driving Experience\n\nThe Q7 is available in two powertrains the first is the Premium 45 TFSI 2.0T Quattro, its a 2.0 liter turbo-charged four-cylinder engine that produces 248 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. This motor is standard on both the Premium and Premium Plus models, with the option of upgrading to the 3.0 liter supercharged V6 engine. \n\nThe Premium 55 TFSI 3.0 Quattro is a 3.0 liter supercharged six-cylinder engine which cranks out 329 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. This motor is available on both the Premium and Premium Plus trim and equipped standard on the Prestige trim model. \n\nAcceleration on the 3.0 liter V6 engine is powerful, smooth and quiet, with more than enough power to pass and merge. \n\nBoth available motors are paired with a Tiptronic eight-speed automatic transmission and quattro all-wheel drive. Reviewers from Edmunds.com state the transmission always seems to be in the right gear at the right time and shifts are seamless and appears to be one of the best in the class.\n\nHandling is agile and the ride is comfortable regardless of your preference for comfort or more of a firm sportier ride. The Q7 base suspension does a great job of minimizing road imperfections, if equipped with the optional adaptive chassis package only available on the Prestige trim model you gain adaptive air suspension system and four-wheel steering which puts the Q7 in the realm of a flagship sedan ride comfort.\n\nAudi drive select allows the driver to change between seven modes which adjust steering effort, transmission shifts, throttle response and ride height when equipped the adaptive air suspension. \n\nEquipped with either suspension the reflex and agility of the Q7 is not compromised. \n\nThe Q7 is quiet, plain and simple, road noise and wind are greatly diminished despite speed or road conditions. \n\nBraking builds confidence as it remains smooth and controllable under heavy braking and while coming to a complete stop from 60mph at 112 feet, the Q7 had very little nose dive. \n\nIf off-road driving is necessary the adaptive air suspension set to lift/offroad can raise the vehicle and additional two inches for better clearance. \n\nVisibility is good in the Q7 and enhanced with 360-degree top-view camera system.  \n\n### Fuel Efficiency \n\nFuel economy on both the 2.0 liter four-cylinder turbo and the 3.0 liter supercharged V6 motor obtain an EPA estimated 19 mpg city and 25 mpg highway for a combined total of 21 mpg city/highway. Both powertrains require premium unleaded gasoline. \n\n### Pricing and Value\n\nThe Premium base model Q7 with standard 2.0 liter turbo four-cylinder motor before additional packages or options begins at $54,545 including the $995 destination fee. \n\nThe Premium Plus model with the standard 2.0 liter turbo four-cylinder motor which adds the advanced key, MMI Navigation Plus package, Audi side assist with pre sense rear, rear cross traffic assist, vehicle exit assist, LED interior lighting package, electric tilt/telescoping steering column, 3D BOSE surround sound system, Audi Virtual Cockpit, top-view camera system, Audi phone box with wireless charging and signal booster starts at $57,895 including destination before additional packages or options. \n\nThe Prestige model with the standard 3.0 liter supercharged V6 motor, 20-inch 10-spoke wheels, LED Interior Lighting Plus package, Warm Weather package that includes four zone climate control, front seat ventilation, rear shades for doors and tailgate, Head-up display, Driver assistance package which includes Active lane assist, Park steering assist, Traffic sign recognition, Full LED headlights starts at $69,695 including destination before additional options and packages. \n\nConsidering the competition the Audi Q7 is a great value because it has an array of standard, technology and safety features that are costly additional options on other competitor vehicles.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["SUV","Review","Luxury"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/audi-q7#year_min=2019\u0026year_max=2019","modified_date":"2019-05-29T00:18:31.650Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4Zqzm2mvoArU0GJfnYgqv6/29edd86773ec7e3dc104313f9d0f8e26/2019-chevy-suburban-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/49PsqF8sFDaOJMgHAzD64u/d11ad1ec92bc9cccbb11c47687edd480/2019-chevy-suburban-325-image.jpg","slug":"2019-chevy-suburban-review","title":"2019 Chevy Suburban Review","publication_date":"2019-05-24T09:36-08:00","content_summary":"Learn more about the many trims levels and special editions of the all-new 2019 Chevrolet Suburban in our 2019 Chevy Suburban Review.

Efficiency and smoothness are further maximized by a 6-speed automatic transmission (standard for both engine types). The 6.2-liter V8 is available only on Premium models. The RST Premium package also features a 10-speed automatic transmission. Both transmissions feature Tow/Haul Mode to reduce shift cycling for better control and optimized cooling when towing or carrying heavy cargo.\n\nUsers report impressive handling and smoothness when driving the 2019 Chevy Suburban. It may not be a sports car, but the Chevy Suburban makes full use of its modern suspension, engine, and transmission to provide an excellent driving experience on everything from long stretches of highway and to curving city streets. Drivers report that taking rounded turns at moderate to high speeds only produces minimal lean and roll, while handling overall is responsive and well weighted. Vibrations are at a minimum thanks to the Suburban’s Premium Smooth Ride suspension standard on LS an LT models. (Premium Smooth Ride suspension with an air leveler is available on LS and LT models). Premium models feature Magnetic Ride Control, which monitors each wheel independently and adjusts suspension every millisecond for the smoothest ride possible. Each of these suspension systems is capable of handling light to moderate off-roading.\n\nAcceleration is responsive in the 2019 Chevy Suburban. Visibility is adequate in the 2019 Chevy Suburban, though users have noted the sizable blind spots on driver and passenger sides. A large windshield and many advanced driver assistance features compensate for the bulk of the 2019 Chevy Suburban and ensure visibility (even if technology-aided).\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Fuel Efficiency\n\nThough not incredibly fuel-efficient by smaller-vehicle standards, the 2019 Chevrolet Suburban does relatively well in its class. Suburban models with 2WD and a 5.3-liter V8 engine get an EPA-estimated fuel economy 15 miles per gallon in the city and 22 miles per gallon on the highway. Models with 4WD and a 5.3-liter V8 engine get 14 miles per gallon in the city and 21 miles per gallon on the highway. Suburban models with 2WD and a 6.2-liter V8 engine get an EPA-estimated fuel economy of 14 miles per gallon in the city and 23 miles per gallon on the highway. Models with 4WD and a 6.2-liter V8 engine get 14 miles per gallon in the city and 20 miles per gallon on the highway. These metrics are nearly identical to those of the [GMC Yukon XL](https://www.autolist.com/gmc-yukon+xl) and slightly under those of the [Cadillac Escalade ESV](https://www.autolist.com/cadillac-escalade+esv).\n\n### Pricing and Value\n\nLike most vehicles in its class, the 2019 Chevrolet Suburban is not inexpensive, but for its price, it packs a lot of size and an incredible amount of features. The base LS model sells new for $52,095 (including destination) for a basic 2WD version, while mid-range LT models start at $57,095. 2WD Premier models featuring the 5.3-liter V8 engine and a 6-speed transmission start at $66,795, while 2WD Premier models featuring the 6.2-liter V8 engine and a 10-speed transmission start at $72,220. (You can expect to add $3,000 for 4WD.) This price is markedly higher than that of a [Nissan Armada](https://www.autolist.com/nissan-armada) or [Toyota Sequoia](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-sequoia), but the Chevrolet Suburban also offers markedly more space. The 2019 Chevrolet Suburban is now considerably less expensive than the newest [Ford Expedition](https://www.autolist.com/ford-expedition) Max, though it is not quite as sophisticated. Those in search of value will find the 2019 Chevrolet Suburban to be a far better choice than the [GMC Yukon XL](https://www.autolist.com/gmc-yukon+xl) and the [Cadillac Escalade ESV](https://www.autolist.com/cadillac-escalade+esv). However, as with the Ford Expedition Max, these higher price tags come with a set of more sophisticated features. If modern features are essential for you, you still may be able to find a Suburban at a higher trim level to satisfy your preferences. If you are in search of modern driving amenities without the extra-extra flourishes, the 2019 Chevrolet Suburban is the SUV for you.\n\n### More Photos\n\nSee more [2019 Chevy Suburban Photos](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-suburban/2019-chevy-suburban-photos).","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["SUV","Review"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-suburban#year_min=2019\u0026year_max=2019","modified_date":"2019-05-29T01:03:11.187Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3qo4aBSKnvro7yuI3Zutuu/b83202283031b6b73d38052849956e5f/2019-jeep-grand-cherokee-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6VFwM5cbdRvo4Al15KagVZ/0cfba0ed7d9f3f8ba7daf0db0296f5b3/2019-jeep-grand-cherokee-325-image.jpg","slug":"2019-jeep-grand-cherokee-review","title":"2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee Review","publication_date":"2019-05-23T14:15-08:00","content_summary":"Learn more about the many safety and performance features of 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee in this comprehensive 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee review","parent_page":{"name":"Jeep Grand Cherokee","description":"Jeep Grand Cherokee","slug":"jeep-grand+cherokee"},"categories":[{"name":"Car Review","description":"Autolist Car Review","parentCategory":{"name":"Reviews","description":"Reviews"}}],"category":{"name":"Car Review","description":"Autolist Car Review","parentCategory":{"name":"Reviews","description":"Reviews"}},"author":{"name":"David Undercoffler","title":"Editor-in-chief","email":"david@autolist.com"},"body":"### Summary\n\nThe 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee is a mid-sized SUV and the fourth generation of Jeep’s Grand Cherokee line. It features a powerful engine lineup, a selection of luxury interior options, and excellent off-road capabilities. Though it is priced competitively with SUVs like the [Ford Edge](https://www.autolist.com/ford-edge), [Toyota 4Runner](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-4runner), and [Nissan Murano](https://www.autolist.com/nissan-murano), the Grand Cherokee is considered by many to belong in the same echelon as higher-end midsized SUVs like the [Land Rover Discovery](https://www.autolist.com/land+rover-discovery), [Volvo XC60](https://www.autolist.com/volvo-xc60), and [BMW X5](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-x5).\n\nWith spacious 5-person seating, modern interior options, and best-in-class off-road performance, the 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee is engineered for drivers in search of an affordably-priced SUV that optimizes handling, space usage, and interior comfort.\n\nFor the 2019 line, the Grand Cherokee comes with blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic assist. The 2019 lineup features a wide selection of different models, including the all-new Limited X trim, which features an 8.4-inch Uconnect touch-screen navigation radio, a vented hood, and graphite crystal trim. Other new features include new 20-inch wheels on the Summit and Overland trim models. There are five engine options on the Grand Cherokee, the most common being the 3.6-liter V6 or 5.7-liter Hemi V8. The most powerful is the 707-horsepower 6.2-liter supercharged V8 engine in the Trackhawk. The base model is the Laredo, while the most feature-loaded is the Trackhawk. All 2019 Grand Cherokee models feature an 8-speed automatic transmission.\n\nOther attractive options on the 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee include advanced four-wheel drive (4WD), Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and ventilated front seats on select trims.\n\n### Exterior\n \nThe 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee features a strong-but-not-bulky, elegant exterior. In keeping with its off-road character, the Grand Cherokee boasts an impressive 8.6 inches of ground clearance, with only the SRT and Trackhawk models sitting lower (8.3 and 8.1 inches respectively).\n\n![2019-jeep-grand-cherokee-exterior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2ONj3YkoQ0UPXhaSv4uYXZ/6fc4e1353de1342a74c8c7147a0ee0e7/2019-jeep-grand-cherokee-exterior1.jpg)\n\nThough the Grand Cherokee sports a considerable clearance, most drivers find it easy to enter, making it a good choice for families of all shapes and sizes. Some models feature more extravagant exterior finishes than others. Most notable is the Trackhawk model, which stands out with the word “supercharged” printed across its front doors, plus quad tailpipes, red tow hooks, 18-inch off-road wheels, and an anti-glare hood decal. \n\nThe Grand Cherokee Limited X features a ventilated performance hood which it shares with the SRT model. Some reviewers report that the liftgate is slightly difficult to reach at full extension; however, users can opt for a power-operated liftgate to solve this issue.\n\n![2019-jeep-grand-cherokee-exterior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2G1QMPFHz1LppXFnHKDHeX/b1157a389ebd3991d0610913c9d08795/2019-jeep-grand-cherokee-exterior2.jpg)\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort\n\nThe 10-model 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee spans the better half of the comfort spectrum, with base models offering standard comfort options that are great for the price and higher-end models boasting extra comfort perks that compete with today’s best luxury SUVs. All 2019 Grand Cherokees have two-row, 5-passenger seating. This layout offers 36.3 cubic feet for storage room behind the back row of seats, which fold down with a single-action release to expand to 68.3 cubic feet of room.\n\n![2019-jeep-grand-cherokee-interior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3P1AW8tUCMd4w2n1pBzUhU/606a6a1763b61e7aed465c709b2d459a/2019-jeep-grand-cherokee-interior1.jpg)\n\nThe base Laredo model features manually-adjusted cloth front seats and dual-zone climate control. Stepping up only one model upgrades the driver to a power-operated seat. Most higher-end models feature leather interiors with ventilated and heated front seats. Higher-end models can also come with a heated steering wheel. Interior material packages include Premium Cloth, Capri Leather Trim, Natura Plus Leather Trim With Ventilated Front, Laguna Leather With Ventilated Front, Nappa Plus Leather Trim With Ventilated Front, and Perforated Laguna Leather With Ventilated Front. Across all models, Grand Cherokee’s infotainment system is responsive and intuitive, though the manual buttons than supplement the touchscreen are a bit redundant.\n\n### Utility and Practicality\n\nEngineered for performance in addition to comfort, the 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee sports a host of design features optimized for utility. 36.3 cubic feet of storage room expands to a generous 68.3 cubic feet with the rear row of seats down. A powered, hands-free liftgate is an option, which makes loading and unloading that much easier. The Grand Cherokee has an impressive 7,400-pound tow rating for the more powerful V-8 or diesel engine models and a 6200-pound tow rating with the gas-fed V-6.\n\n### Technology and Infotainment\n\nUp front on the dash, the 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee features a reliable and intuitive infotainment system powered by the well-reviewed Uconnect. The base Laredo model is equipped with a 7-inch touchscreen, while higher-end models feature an 8.4-inch touchscreen. Rear-seat entertainment and in-vehicle Wi-Fi are also available options. Users can wirelessly connect to Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, use integrated Voice Command, and listen to optional Sirius XM radio. An optional 506-watt Harman/Kardon audio system with 19 speakers is a marked step-up from the 6-speaker standard system. The front media hub features two USB ports, additional auxiliary ports, and 12-volt charging ports on all models. Navigation powered by Uconnect is available on higher-end models.\n\n![2019-jeep-grand-cherokee-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7afhtwwFlXv7RIIEEHV1OQ/ee8899a622f1c059da58decd70e14c89/2019-jeep-grand-cherokee-interior2.jpg)\n\n### Safety and Driving Assistance\n\nThe rear-wheel drive 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee models received three out of five stars in the NHTSA’s rollover tests. The four-wheel drive models received four out of five stars. 2019 Grand Cherokee models performed well on the IIHS’s series of crash tests, earning “Good” scores across the board. The only category in which the Grand Cherokee received a “Moderate” score was headlight performance. The 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee owes much of its safety performance to its state-of-the-art safety features, including blind-spot monitors, rear cross-traffic, alert parking sensors, and a back-up camera, all of which are standard on all models. The Jeep Active Safety package — optional on Limited, Overland, and Trailhawk models — further augments safety. This package includes adaptive cruise control, lane-departure warning, lane-keeping assist, automated emergency braking, forward-collision warning, and parking assist features. All of these features are standard on the top-of-the-line Summit model.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Driving Experience\n\nEngineered for off-road performance and optimized for comfort, the 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee brings drivers best-in-class handling with hues of luxury. The Grand Cherokee features five different engines. Most models contain the 3.6-liter V6 or 5.7-liter Hemi V8 engine, while some have the 3.0-liter diesel V6. The Grand Cherokee SRT contains a 6.4-liter V8 engine that packs 475 horsepower can accelerate to 60 mph in 4.8 seconds. The most powerful and final engine is the 707-horsepower 6.2-liter supercharged V8 engine on the Trackhawk model. V6 Grand Cherokee engines The V6 engines have rear-wheel drive (2WD) standard and 4-wheel drive (4WD) optional. All V8 models are 4WD. All 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee models are equipped with an 8-speed automatic transmission.\n\nWith good handling and secure feel, the 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee is a capable off-road vehicle. High-performance Trackhawk and SRT models feature a Bilstein Adaptive Suspension system to absorb shock and a rear Electronic Limited Slip Differential to evenly distribute power to the wheels. The Trailhawk also features skid plates, tow hooks, and an anti-glare decal for increased performance in any condition. For optimized grip, the Jeep Quadra-Trac Active On-Demand 4x4 System on SRT and Trackhawk utilize a full-time active transfer case for excellent traction on any terrain. Some drivers report a rather bumpy ride on pockmarked pavement in models without air suspension. Some users also report that Grand Cherokee’s brake pedal feels spongy, though all models feature capable brake systems. ABS and Driveline Traction control are standard on all models, with anti-lock and Brembo performance brakes available on select trims. Steering is precise yet substantial; the Jeep isn’t particularly sensitive, but it drives straight. Visibility is adequate across all models, with the Trailhawk’s anti-glare decal adding extra brightness control during sunny driving.\n\nUconnect gives drivers the ability to see real-time performance metrics, including power and torque ratings, fluid and pressure gauges, and more, all from the Grand Cherokee's center screen.\n\n### Fuel Efficiency\n\nCompared to other SUVs in its class, the 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee is relatively fuel efficient. The real-wheel drive Laredo gets an EPA-estimated 19 mpg in the city and 26 mpg on the highway. The four-wheel drive base model gets 18/25 mpg. Estimates place models with V8 engines around 11-14 mpg in the city and 17-22 mpg on the highway. Models equipped with the turbodiesel engine can get up to 22 mpg in the city and 30 mpg on the highway, some of the best fuel economy of any midsize SUV on the market.\n\n### Price \n\nMost reviewers consider all models in the 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee to be good new car deals given their features, performance, and competition. The base model Grand Cherokee Laredo with 2WD starts at just under $33,200 including destination. Slightly higher up the ladder, other trims start around the $40,000 mark and can easily jump several thousand dollars depending on the options added. The Trailhawk, a popular off-road model, starts a $45,500, and the Summit starts over $50,000. SRT models start at $69,650, while top-of-the-line Grand Cherokee Trackhawk models can run anywhere from $80,000 to $100,000, depending on included options. Though expensive for a Jeep, this price point is still considerably lower than a comparable [Porsche Cayenne](https://www.autolist.com/porsche-cayenne). Less-than-luxury competitors like the [Subaru Outback](https://www.autolist.com/subaru-outback) and the [Ford Edge](https://www.autolist.com/ford-edge) are cheaper than comparable Grand Cherokee models, but Jeeps are equipped with a standard V6 engine vs. a 4-cylinder engine on the Ford and Subaru.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["SUV","Review"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/jeep-grand+cherokee#year_min=2019\u0026year_max=2019","modified_date":"2019-05-24T23:41:42.587Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4l3Jiz0X758HvmqPUP2eg5/4bf946fc314ac18aa7af78232cd36cfc/2019-honda-odyssey-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7DmpwgSvqhTDtT3rqy4W9E/7ae1fd39a861211b1a2f1ae0bd87d947/2019-honda-odyssey-325-image.jpg","slug":"2019-honda-odyssey-review","title":"2019 Honda Odyssey Review","publication_date":"2019-05-22T12:15-08:00","content_summary":"The Honda Odyssey competes with the Toyota Sienna and Kia Sedona, and is a practical vehicle with modern safety features, lots of technology, and generous cargo room.

It's aimed at families with children, as well as people who are looking for a practical vehicle that utilizes modern safety features, lots of technology, and offers generous cargo room. The Odyssey carries over into the 2019 model year unchanged from last year when it received a complete redesign.\n\n### Exterior\n\nThe Odyssey has garnered praise for its unique and sharp looking exterior that shares cues with other Honda models like the stylized LED headlights and heavily creased body panels. Its overall length is 203\", making it three inches longer than the [Toyota Sienna](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-sienna) and roughly two inches longer than the [Kia Sedona](ttps://www.autolist.com/kia-sedona). It's also an inch wider than both of those models, while all three are approximately the same height.\n\n![2019-honda-odyssey-exterior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6O8gtymALJLV6BiAXVg216/4d55ce2115d7798ae3e74255df261410/2019-honda-odyssey-exterior1.jpg)\n\nHonda lists the 2019 Odyssey's curb weight between 4,354 and 4,593 pounds. For comparison, the [Sienna](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-sienna) weighs in at a more substantial 4,430 to 4,750, the [Sedona](https://www.autolist.com/kia-sedona) is listed at 4,411 to 4,517 pounds, and the [Pacifica](https://www.autolist.com/chrysler-pacifica) is 4,330 pounds, making the Odyssey the second lightest of the group.\n\n![2019-honda-odyssey-exterior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4oWALQT8BM3U7jyUjqnwFx/83d7bcf865f89b8d01882631d416fd6c/2019-honda-odyssey-exterior2.jpg)\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Interior Quality \u0026 Comfort\n\nLike all minivans, the Odyssey's primary objective is to carry passengers in comfort and safety. The 2019 Odyssey seats up to seven passengers thanks to three rows of seating including the front seats. The second-row seats can be configured with either bench seating or with Honda's Magic Slide seating system. Magic Slide allows the middle seats to slide in multiple directions independently of each other, providing easier access to the third-row seats. Up front, the two captain's chairs can be upgraded to include heating and cooling.\n\nThe dash of the Odyssey is clean and uncluttered, and soft-touch materials are used in the high traffic areas. All pertinent driving data is displayed on a seven-inch Digital Driver Information Interface screen located in the instrument cluster. The interface comes as standard equipment on all Odysseys except for the base LX trim package and can be customized to display a range of information like navigation, incoming calls, and various safety systems. A second eight-inch touchscreen is located to the right of the driver on the dashboard that contains the infotainment system and automatic climate controls. \n\n![2019-honda-odyssey-interior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/sqZlbfBfQbltCGoxRwANK/f91b2a0c691e0123fda65593f61dae43/2019-honda-odyssey-interior1.jpg)\n\nPassengers in the Odyssey have 40.9/40.9/38.1 inches of legroom going from the front/middle/rear seats. In the [Toyota Sienna](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-sienna), passengers have 40.5/37.6/36.3 inches of legroom front to back respectively. The [Kia Sedona](https://www.autolist.com/kia-sedona) offers 40.9/41.1/34.8 inches, and the [Chrysler Pacifica](https://www.autolist.com/chrysler-pacifica) has 41.1/39/36.5 inches. The Odyssey also provides 40.7/39.5/38.3 inches of headroom and 58.6/64.8/48.4 inches of hip room.\n\nLeather-trimmed seating is optional on some models of the Odyssey and is standard equipment on the EX-L, Touring, and Elite. Also available is a heated leather-wrapped steering wheel, three-zone climate control, and sunshades for the second and third rows of seats. Outward visibility is satisfactory all around thanks to small side pillars and available exterior cameras.\n\nHonda has paid particular attention to interior noise with the Odyssey and taken steps to keep the cabin quiet, responding to some reviewer criticisms of the previous model. Acoustic foam has been applied in strategic locations throughout the vehicle, and the Odyssey also makes use of thicker window glass, barrier carpet, triple door seals, and noise cancellation under the hood. \n\nOther equipment and accessories for the Odyssey include all-weather floor mats, a rubber liner for the cargo bin behind the rear seats, a molded vinyl cargo mat, illuminated door sills, seat covers for the second-row chairs, and a cargo net for the rear storage area.\n\n### Utility \u0026 Practicality\n\nCargo space in the Odyssey is the best in its class. With the seats are up, the Odyssey offers 38.6 cubic feet of cargo room. Folding the rear seats down increases that to number to 92. When the middle seats are stowed and the rear seats removed, the available cargo space grows to 158 cubic feet, enough to accommodate a full-sized sheet of plywood. The rear cargo area also has a recessed section in the floor that can store loose items that might otherwise move around while driving.\n\n![2019-honda-odyssey-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5dxbjYRkK1y6ZWOiKLrGjs/ad609f8990e73788c5f603d1413823c8/2019-honda-odyssey-interior2.jpg)\n\nAnother of the Odyssey's useful features is the HondaVAC vacuum system built into the rear cargo area. This small vacuum uses a flexible hose and wide nozzle that allows owners to clean up dirt and spills, and stores the material in a removable container that's quickly emptied.\n\nThe Odyssey can also be fitted with a trailer hitch for lighter towing jobs. Honda rates the vehicle as being able to tow between 3,000 and 3,500 pounds.\n\n![2019-honda-odyssey-exterior3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2M61vKrYNavCsB5fa79svw/e7ec23a20e69ca3f5f78f68cc868e2cc/2019-honda-odyssey-exterior3.jpg)\n\n### Technology \u0026 Infotainment\n\nHonda has equipped to Odyssey with a substantial amount of technology designed for both safety and entertainment. Standard equipment on all models includes items like hands-free Bluetooth, a rearview camera, lane departure warning, USB ports both front and rear, push-button start, and an electronic gear selector. \n\nThe Odyssey has been paired with the HondaLink mobile app which allows owners to check the fuel level, remotely start the engine, adjust the temperature inside the vehicle, and control the doors and locks. With the CabinControl Social Playlist function, anyone in the vehicle with the CabinControl app on their mobile device can add a song to the car's playlist.\n\n![2019-honda-odyssey-interior3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6BnJA9EpIQIiEkv0vNdx4q/7ff70c35c2a2bc954644cbfb809a3538/2019-honda-odyssey-interior3.jpg)\n\nMost minivans will be used to carry children as the primary passengers, and the Odyssey has a full suite of technology explicitly geared for rear passenger entertainment and safety. Honda's CabinWatch system utilizes a camera with night vision built into the ceiling that keeps an eye on the rear passengers and displays the video feed on the main screens in the cabin. The available rear-seat entertainment system can stream several different audio apps, connect to 4G LTE through an AT\u0026T data plan and play specific video apps, play DVDs and Blu-Ray discs, and it offers accessibility functions for those with disabilities. The Odyssey also utilizes Honda's CabinTalk, a system that allows the front passengers to communicate with passengers over the vehicle's speakers.\n\nOn the entertainment front is an available mobile hotspot system that gives the Odyssey its own Wi-Fi signal. There's also an available navigation system, Apple Car Play and Android Auto integration, and a wireless charging system for mobile devices.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Safety \u0026 Driving Assistance\n\nAnother of the Odyssey's safety systems is the Honda Sensing suite. Included are the Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS), which can brake the vehicle when an object is detected. Road Departure Mitigation System (RDM) uses several cameras that watch the road and ahead and helps keep the vehicle safely on the road. Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) adjusts the vehicle's speed when cruising to maintain a set following interval. And Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS) also uses exterior cameras and can adjust the vehicle's steering if it senses it's straying from a determined lane. Other driver assistance features include ABS, traction control, and stability control. The Odyssey also features Snow Mode, a driving mode that adjusts the traction control system to improve drivability in poor conditions.\n\nThe 2019 Odyssey has been selected by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) as a Top Safety Pick, earning Good ratings (the best possible rating) for nearly all crashworthiness areas with only the headlight area scoring a grade of Acceptable. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) gave the Odyssey a five-star crash test rating, also the best possible score from that organization. Passengers are protected by front-impact, side-impact, overhead, and knee airbags, and anti-whiplash head restraints which automatically activate when a rear-end collision has been detected. \n\n### Driving Experience\n\nThere are two different transmissions available for the Odyssey. The base unit found in the LX, EX, EX-L, trim levels is a nine-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters behind the steering wheel. Upgrading to the Touring and Elite models upgrades to a 10-speed automatic transmission. All Odyssey models are paired to Honda's 3.5-liter V6 engine that produces 280 horsepower and 262 lb.-ft. of torque and routes power to the front wheels. There is no all-wheel-drive option available.\n\nA unique feature of the engine is Honda's Variable Cylinder Mangement (VCM). This system means the engine can run on three, four, or six cylinder configurations to increase fuel economy. Additionally, higher trim levels come with an engine start/stop function that can turn the engine off completely when in an idling situation. Several reviewers reported that the engine start/stop system wasn't the smoothest and could cause the vehicle to jerk slightly when restarting the engine.\n\nWhile spirited driving isn't generally associated with minivans, the Odyssey has won praise from numerous reviewers for its potent engine, smooth acceleration, and solid brakes. Handling in the Odyssey is also reportedly very good and was particularly adept at handling rough roads and providing a continually comfortable ride. It hit 60 miles per hour from a standstill in 6.9 seconds and stopped from that speed in 124 feet. Another strong point according to testers was the 10-speed transmission which changed gears quickly, smoothly, and helped improve the overall drying dynamics.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Fuel Efficiency\n\nFuel economy for the Odyssey is respectable. It achieves an EPA estimated 19/28 MPG city/highway for a combined 22 MPG. For comparison, the 2019 [Kia Sedona](https://www.autolist.com/kia-sedona) returns 18/24/21 MPG city/highway/combined, the [Toyota Sienna](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-sienna) gets 19/27/20 MPG city/highway/combined, and the [Chrysler Pacifica](https://www.autolist.com/chrysler-pacifica) achieves 19/28/22 MPG city/highway/combined MPG. \n\nWhile the Odyssey bests or equals its competition in fuel efficiency in most scenarios, it does lose out to the [Chrysler Pacifica](https://www.autolist.com/chrysler-pacifica) Hybrid, the only minivan to offer a hybrid powertrain. The [Pacifica](https://www.autolist.com/chrysler-pacifica) Hybrid achieves around 30 MPG combined, thanks to the assistance provided by its electric motors and battery pack.\n\n### Pricing \u0026 Value\n\nKelley Blue Book awarded the 2019 Odyssey with its Best Buy: Minivan award. According to Kelley Blue Book's website, \"The winner of this award is an all-new or significantly redesigned vehicle that represents exceptional innovation and value in transportation today.\" The 2019 Odyssey has also been recognized as the Best Minivan for Families by U.S. News \u0026 World Report. It received the 2019 ALG Residual Value Award, as well as the 2019 Edmunds Buyers Most Wanted Award.\n\nPrices for the Honda Odyssey minivan start at $31,235 including $1,045 for destination charge for the base LX model. Standard equipment on the LX includes keyless ignition, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, USB ports, power mirrors, and an eight-way adjustable driver's seat.\n\nStep up to the Odyssey EX, and items like dual power sliding passenger doors, HD radio, the Honda Sensing suite, Magic Slide seats, HondaLink connectivity, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto come as standard equipment for $35,205 with destination included.\n\nThe Odyssey EX-L offers all the features found on the two previous trim levels and adds standard items like blind spot monitoring, leather-trimmed seating, power tailgate, and the One-Touch Moonroof for $38,755. The EX-L can also be equipped with Honda's navigation system and upgraded infotainment. \n\nOdyssey Touring starts at $45,805 including destination. At this trim level, the 10-speed transmission becomes available, and the interior is equipped with features like CabinWatch, rear entertainment system, front and rear parking sensors, 4G LTE capability, the HondaVAC system, and satellite-linked navigation system. \n\nThe final available trim is the Odyssey Elite. Elite includes premium elements such as heated and cooled front seats, wireless phone charging, an 11 speaker audio system, rain-sensing windshield wipers, gloss black interior trim, and 19-inch alloy wheels. Prices for the Elite start at $48,115 with destination included.\n\nThere's no getting around the fact that the Honda Odyssey is not an inexpensive vehicle. However, between its five different trim levels, safety, technology, packaging and storage solutions, and various options, it does offer a lot of vehicle for the money. A base model Toyota Sienna stickers at $32,510 including destination, nearly $1,300 more than the Odyssey, while a similarly equipped [Chrysler Pacifica](https://www.autolist.com/chrysler-pacifica) stickers for $28,480 with the destination fee. A 2019 [Kia Sedona](https://www.autolist.com/kia-sedona)'s base MSRP starts at $27,200 before the $1,045 destination charge.\n\nPrevious versions of the Honda Odyssey are reportedly reliable vehicles and have triggered few formal recalls. The Odyssey is covered by a three year/36,000 mile limited warranty and a five year/60,000 mile powertrain warranty.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Minivan","Review"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/honda-odyssey#year_min=2019\u0026year_max=2019","modified_date":"2019-05-24T23:36:37.105Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3OZ3Nr6z5S1UhaCjeJQnLo/1051f783fc49072cf6db6f8104b8e6d5/2019-chevy-tahoe-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6ktXhQDaVYqlVbNbZwXRKy/ad84236f412c81fc5d6327095c168d3d/2019-chevy-tahoe-325-image.jpg","slug":"2019-chevy-tahoe-review","title":"2019 Chevy Tahoe Review","publication_date":"2019-05-21T10:44-08:00","content_summary":"2019 Tahoe packages and features such as Premier, Magnetic Ride Control, Teen Driver System, 4WD, Bose 10-speaker Premium Audio system, and Enhanced Driver Alert package.","parent_page":{"name":"Chevrolet Tahoe","slug":"chevrolet-tahoe"},"categories":[{"name":"Car Review","description":"Autolist Car Review","parentCategory":{"name":"Reviews","description":"Reviews"}}],"category":{"name":"Car Review","description":"Autolist Car Review","parentCategory":{"name":"Reviews","description":"Reviews"}},"author":{"name":"David Undercoffler","title":"Editor-in-chief","email":"david@autolist.com"},"body":"### Summary\n\nThe 2019 Chevrolet Tahoe is an American full-size SUV that can seat up to 9 passengers. The Tahoe is the kid brother of the [Chevrolet Suburban](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-suburban) which has remained popular and aimed to attract new car buyers that seek a large a SUV with truck-like capability and towing capacity. The Chevy Tahoe competes with the [Ford Expedition](https://www.autolist.com/ford-expedition), [GMC Yukon](https://www.autolist.com/gmc-yukon), [Toyota Sequoia](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-sequoia), [Nissan Armada](https://www.autolist.com/nissan-armada), [Dodge Durango](https://www.autolist.com/dodge-durango) and other large crossovers like the [Acura MDX](https://www.autolist.com/acura-mdx), [Honda Pilot](https://www.autolist.com/honda-pilot), [Infiniti QX60](https://www.autolist.com/infiniti-qx60) and the [Toyota Highlander](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-highlander). The 2019 model is unchanged but introduced last year is the Premier Plus configuration which offers a larger EcoTec3 6.2 liter V8 engine paired with a 10 speed automatic transmission opposed to the standard EcoTec3 5.3 liter V8 engine paired with a Hydra-Matic 6 speed transmission. \n\n### Exterior\n\nThe Chevrolet Tahoe is a full-sized SUV with a truck-like physical appearance. It sits as tall as its pick-up siblings however over the years they've become less wide which enables more confident handling in parking lots and tighter spaces. \n\n![2019-chevy-tahoe-exterior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6NVBedPC5dK1envQNr8F0R/764727241c0c716b40942c50df0a5a6b/2019-chevy-tahoe-exterior1.jpg)\n\nThe exterior for 2019 is unchanged except for the Premier Plus Edition which includes extra chrome accents on the power steps and exhaust tips. The RST (Rally Sport Truck) Performance Edition includes 22-inch sport wheels and tires and exchanges chrome accents for black trim accents.\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort\n\nThe overall fit and finish of the Tahoe is impressive from the base model to the more luxurious high end trim packages which include leather. The front dashboard has a lot of soft touch portions but hard plastics still remain throughout the rest of the interior. \n\nThe dashboard is very clean looking and nicely trimmed. The center piece features a 8 inch infotainment touch screen with optional navigation and head up display. Dual-zone automatic climate control is standard on all models.\n\n![2019-chevy-tahoe-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4cddqQbKSQSQzq0umDfc9a/637e44dbfd94ad59d595069d4cfd5827/2019-chevy-tahoe-interior2.jpg)\n\nAll 2019 Tahoes come with bucket front seats and full power for the driver seat. A front bench seat is available on the LS trim level. All seats are comfortable in the first and second rows, the third-row seats however are a bit more tighter in terms of leg room and accessibility which makes it ideal for smaller adults and children. The second row is equipped with a 60/40 foldable bench seat but you also have the option of a second row pair of captain seats that make accessing the third row much easier. The third row seats fold away but do not tuck away completely flat. Those who don't need or care for a third row can delete the third row in the LS trim by selecting  the Custom Edition package which will gain 18-inch aluminum wheels and tires, a unique chrome grille insert and shave off over four thousand dollars from the bottom line. The LATCH system anchors are present for both the second and third row seats. \n\nInstallation on the third row can be difficult to locate on the initial use as the anchors are concealed behind a fabric flap. \n\n### Utility and Practicality \n\nWith both second and third row rear seats folded down the Tahoe offers 94.7 cubic feet of space however it is still subpar for its class. Cargo space with the third row folded down enables access to 51.7 cubic feet of cargo space still not quite as much as its rivals. Behind the third row seats are 15.3 cubic feet of cargo space which is comparable to some mid-size sedan trunks. Chevy also offers an optional retractable cargo cover to use when the third row is not in use. \n\nThe Chevrolet Tahoe can tow up to 6,400 pounds out of the gate, but when equipped with the Max Trailering Package it is capable of towing 8,400 pounds. The Max Trailering package includes an upgraded rear axle, integrated trailer brake controller, Autotrac 2-speed transfer case and premium smooth ride suspension with an air leveler. \n\n![2019-chevy-tahoe-exterior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5Lubmao41oV2gU5gxcxM65/a1030713fcdcaf49fa62930bd757193a/2019-chevy-tahoe-exterior2.jpg)\n\nAll Tahoes are equipped with standard roof mounted side rails and available roof rack cross rails. The base model Tahoe has a manual lift gate, there are two additional options available, one is a programmable power lift gate and the other is a hands-free programmable power lift gate. \n\n### Technology and Infotainment\n\nThe Tahoe features a standard 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Bluetooth hands-free capability and streaming audio for up to two connected devices and AT\u0026T 4G LTE Wi-Fi equipped which requires a data plan. Available with a subscription is OnStar's Turn-by-Turn navigation read aloud with on-screen prompts. Also available is the myChevrolet Mobile app that allows compatible mobile devices to start or stop your engine, lock or unlock your vehicles doors, send destinations to your available navigation system, view diagnostics and set parking reminders from your mobile device with a paid plan. \n\n![2019-chevy-tahoe-interior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4abhc8hOtN3y8O9ekE4HF2/e8ca954cea9b1470286604899594bff5/2019-chevy-tahoe-interior1.jpg)\n\nTahoe offers up to seven USB ports, a 110 volt three-prong outlet and an available wireless charging station with the Premier trim. A rear-seat entertainment system with Blu-ray is available on the LT and Premier trim which feature either a 9 or 10 speaker Bose premium audio surround sound audio system. \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Safety and Driving Assistance \n\nThe 2019 Tahoe has not yet been rated by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) gave the Tahoe a five out of five-star rating for side impact ratings and three out of five star rollover resistance rating. The front impact rating for the 2019 Tahoe is not yet posted on the NHTSA website. Because this model year does not have any major design changes it is worthy to mention the 2018 Tahoe has a four our five-star overall rating with both front and side impact receiving five out of five-star rating and the overall score lowered because of the three out of five-star rollover resistance rating. \n\nStandard safety features on all trim levels include StabiliTrak, electronic stability control system with traction control, rearview camera, rear park assist, seven airbags and Chevrolet's Teen Driver System that allows owners to customize and set limits on speed, audio volume and keeps records of driving behavior to review.  \n\nAvailable on the LT trim with the Enhanced Driver Alert package features Low Speed Forward Automatic Braking, Forward Collison Alert, Lane Keep Assist with Lane Departure Warning and Safety Alert Seat which vibrates to warn of impending collision.\n\nAvailable only on The Premier trim the Tahoe features Lane Change Alert with Blind Spot Alert, Front and Rear Park Assist, Rear Cross Traffic Alert and Forward Collision Automatic Braking. \n\n### Driving Experience \n\nThe standard motor on all Tahoe trim levels is a 5.3 liter V8 packing 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque. The 6.2 liter V8 with 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque is only available on the Premier trim level with the Premier Plus Edition package. Rear-wheel drive is standard on each trim level and four-wheel drive is also available on each trim level however some packages offer upgraded 2-speed transfer cases. \n\nDespite such powerful V8 motors the Tahoe receives praise by reviewers for its quiet cabin shielded from outside disturbances. \n\nThe standard 6-speed transmission and 10-speed transmission both pair well with their respective motors. Both transmissions shift smoothly with timely shifts. Using the standard tow/haul mode permits a smooth steady ride when towing heavy loads, this function will keep the transmission from downshifting too quickly. \n\nIn such a large SUV it is beneficial the Tahoe has light and precise steering, some drivers will find this not as appealing during highway driving but will find it useful in tighter city or parking lot environments. Handling is as expected for a truck with a body on frame design, however on the Premier trim equipped with Magnetic Ride Control used in the [Chevrolet Corvette](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-corvette) and the [Cadillac CTS-V](https://www.autolist.com/cadillac-cts+v) handling, traction, ride and steering are enhanced by the electro-magnetically controlled suspension adjusting to road conditions in milliseconds. \n\nAcceleration in the base model V8 is less than thrilling, some reviewers describe it as lethargic under normal driving but when pushed will unveil its abundant power. The optional 6.2 liter V8 on the Premier trim offer exciting acceleration with each touch of the throttle. \n\nBraking on the Tahoe is soft and has long pedal travel, some drivers will find this unsettling. No need to be concerned because the Tahoe can stop with the best of them. Compared to the much lighter [Chevrolet Camaro](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-camaro) which stops from 60mph-zero in 100 feet, the Tahoe as big and heavy as it is can stop from 60mph-zero in only 123 feet this is essential for a SUV that is capable of towing 8,400 pounds.\n\nOff road capabilities are somewhat limited because of the low clearance on the Tahoe. Even when equipped with the Z71 Off-Road package which adds a 2-speed transfer case, Hill Descent Control, skid plates and upgraded suspension doesn't change the fact the ground clearance on the Tahoe is low for off-roading. \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Fuel Efficiency\n\nEPA estimated fuel economy for the standard 5.3 liter V8 equipped with rear-wheel drive is 15 mpg city and 22 mpg highway for a combined total of 18 mpg city/highway. Compared to its rival Ford Expediton with a base model 3.5 liter V6 turbo achieves an EPA estimated 17 mpg city, 24 mpg highway for a combined total of 20mpg. \n\n### Pricing and Value\n\nThe MSRP for the base model Chevy Tahoe LS equipped with rear-wheel drive and the standard 5.3 liter V8 paired with a 6-speed transmission is $49,790 including the $1,295 destination charge. \n\nThe MSRP for the LT model that includes leather seats, heated bucket seats with memory, power liftgate with programmable height, Bose Premium 9-speaker sound system, Lane Keep Assist with Lane Departure Warning, Low Speed Automatic Braking, safety alert seat, power adjustable pedals, IntelliBeam automatic high beam headlamps and forward collision alert is $54,790 including destination. \n\nMSRP for the Premier trim which includes Magnetic Ride Control, keyless entry with push-button start, HID headlamps, 12-way power-adjustable heated and ventilated front seats, 20-inch wheels, Lane Change Alert with Side Blind Zone Alert, fog lamps,  Front and Rear Park Assist, memory power tilt and telescoping steering wheel column, power-release second-row and power-folding third-row seats and rear cross traffic alert is $64,490 including destination. \n\nCompared to the [Ford Expedition](https://www.autolist.com/ford-expedition) base model priced at $53,525 including a $1,395 destination charge the 2019 Chevrolet Tahoe is great value because for the cost of the base model Expediton you could afford to spring for the LT model with a laundry list of amenities. If the extra amenities are not must haves then you could rest assured knowing you could save $3,735 purchasing the base model Tahoe LS over the [Expedition XLT](https://www.autolist.com/ford-expedition+el-xlt).

The front seats and second row seats are above average comfortable with plush door armrests, the second row comes in two different styles either a pair of captain's chairs which makes getting to the third row much more comfortable or a sliding/folding bench seat, however the third row is better suited for children and smaller stature adults.\n\n![2019-toyota-highlander-interior3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/0hGJ0C4gBo4UO38vfBKAI/74beb6af4cf53e5b0f7b7421286a8454/2019-toyota-highlander-interior3.jpg)\n\nStandard on the base model you'll find fabric seats, 6-way adjustable power driver's seat, a 4-way adjustable front passenger seat, 60/40 split, sliding and reclining, fold flat second row seats, 60/40 split, reclining, fold flat third row seats with sliding headrests. \n\n### Utility and Practicality\n\nThe Highlander offers lots and lots of space for small items with a dashboard shelf that runs the length of the dashboard, a large center console, eight cup holders, four bottle holders, large door pockets and other small compartments in the rear contribute to the numerous storage containers. \n\n![2019-toyota-highlander-exterior3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6JMzhlH53Jr69sV5XBfSYw/077c8eb5b855802908f28b1db16ce6dc/2019-toyota-highlander-exterior3.jpg)\n\nAs far as luggage and cargo space are concerned the Highlander trails behind competitors with all three rows in use, however with both the second and third rows folded down allow for 83 cubic feet of cargo space.

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) ranks the 2019 Toyota Highlander as a top safety pick. The Highlander received a top Superior rating in crash avoidance and mitigation, and headlights received an Acceptable rating. In the crashworthiness category, Highlander received all Good ratings and Acceptable in the category of passenger side small overlap front. \n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) gave the Highlander an overall five-star rating. In overall frontal crash ratings, the Highlander received four out of five stars, in overall side crash ratings the Highlander scored a perfect five out of five stars, in overall rollover rating the Highlander scored four out of five stars. \n\nAll Highlanders are equipped with a standard safety package that includes lane departure alert with steering assist. This feature monitors lane markings and will sound a warning to warn you to steer your vehicle back to the center of the lane and with steering assist activated the Highlander can also guide your vehicle back to the center of the path.\n\nAll standard on the Highlander is the dynamic cruise control. It allows the driver to set a speed as any other traditional cruise control but will use a radar mounted inside the front grille to monitor the vehicle in front of you and slow down and alert you if you need to stop. Once the vehicle in front of you speeds up again or moves to another lane, the Highlander will accelerate back to the preset speed.\n\nUsing the same camera and radar used in the dynamic cruise control, the Highlander is equipped with pedestrian detection and a pre-collision system. These systems will alert you if a potential collision is possible and may apply the brake as you use the brake, however, if you fail to notice soon enough the vehicle will apply the brake to slow the vehicle down to avoid a collision or minimize the impact. \n\nThe Highlander is also equipped with automatic high beams that turn on and off high beams for ideal conditions. \n\n### Driving Experience  \n\nThe Toyota Highlander has three powertrains to choose from. The first two are only available on the LE base model, a 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 185 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, it is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The second powertrain is a 3.5-liter V6 engine that produces 295 horsepower and 263 lb-ft of torque paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission in front-wheel-drive or optional all-wheel-drive. The last powertrain is the Highlander hybrid a 3.5-liter hybrid engine all-wheel drive that produces 306 horsepower. \n\nThe eight-speed transmission shifts smooth and the mid-range power is good, paired with a V6 engine the Highlander is powerful when the pedal is pushed aggressively when accelerating slowly the responsiveness can seem underwhelming.\n\nSteering can feel very light at low speeds but help to maneuver such a large SUV, at higher speeds you notice the steering becomes heavier which will contribute to confident handling and control.  \n\nHandling on turns are not as smooth or tight as could be compared to competitors, the ease of steering helps to make adjustments and alleviate the big SUV body roll. \n\nBumps and imperfections on the road are absorbed well in the Highlander, outside noise and road noise are significantly reduced, the cabin is surprisingly quiet. \n\nAcceleration is on demand, if you punch the pedal you're going to get all 295 horses, the Highlander ran 0 to 60 mph in under eight-seconds, if you're easy on the accelerator you will experience the conservative almost sleepy acceleration. \n\nThe Highlander has a higher clearance than most SUV in the class, and this family-oriented SUV is equipped with hill descent and a locking differential on all-wheel-drive models. \n\nVisibility on the Highlander is excellent the front windshield, and front windows are large and allow for unobstructed views. The full-sized second-row headrests get in the way of over the shoulder glances yet blind spots are minimal. The rear-view camera and 360-degree  camera can help assist with any obstructed views while driving the Highlander sports safety features which include blind-spot monitoring. \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Fuel Efficiency \n\nThe fuel economy on the Highlander is typical of a seven-passenger SUV. The gasoline engines fall right into the middle of the pack of the competition. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) website, the 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine achieves 20 mpg city and 24 mpg highway for a combined rating of 23 mpg. The 3.5-liter V6 engine performs a little better making 20 mpg city and 27 mpg highway for a combined total of 23 mpg.

For now. \n\n---\n\n![003 RANGER 90A0006](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/HWYzbndnzfXeYWbgXbVxI/1b6223027187e2c87d19b4d0d1598a0b/003_RANGER__90A0006.jpg)\n\n## What is it?\nThe Ranger is Ford’s midsize pickup truck. It returned to the U.S. market for the 2019 model year after an eight-year hiatus, during which Ford was adamant truck buyers would gravitate towards a cheap full-size F-150. The market proved otherwise, as rivals like the Toyota Tacoma, Chevrolet Colorado, GMC Canyon and even the aging Nissan Frontier all continued to be extremely popular with buyers. \n\nThis new Ford Ranger isn’t actually completely new, as the basic platform has been on sale in other global markets for several years. But Ford did make significant improvements to ready it for the American market. Thus, despite its age, it vaulted to the top of our midsize truck wishlist with a heady mix of refinement and capability. \n\nAll Rangers in the U.S. come with a 2.3-liter turbocharged EcoBoost four-cylinder engine that makes 270 horsepower and 310 pound-feet of torque. It’s paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission and standard rear-wheel-drive. \n\nAll-wheel-drive is a $4,000 option on all trim levels. \n\nThere are three main trim levels for the Ranger: base XL, XLT and high-end Lariat. \n\nThe Ranger comes in one of two bed/cab configurations. The base setup is the SuperCab with a six-foot bed (the SuperCab is basically an extended cab setup with one full set of doors for front passengers and one set of rear-hinged partial doors for rear-seat access). For around $2,200 more, you can choose the SuperCrew setup, which gives you four full, standard doors and a five-foot bed.  \n\nAn optional $1,295 FX4 package can be added to any of the three trims that have four-wheel-drive. It ups the Ranger’s off-road chops with goodies like an off-road specific suspension, unique 17- or 18-inch wheels, an electronic locking rear differential, skid plates, unique display in instrument panel and a terrain management system. \n\n![19 FRD RGR 41202 XLT-Chrome-4X4-Super-Crew (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4Rs1Vcrb7fkG13rhIm1Rua/e412fb631c47cc2f83a3580921ecb7a3/19_FRD_RGR_41202_XLT-Chrome-4X4-Super-Crew__1_.jpg)\n\n\n\n---\n\n## What’s good\n*TLDR: Efficiency, refinement and visibility*\n\n__Fuel efficient.__ On paper, the new Ranger’s fuel efficiency shines. The EPA rates it at 20/24/22 MPG city/highway/combined for the 4x4 model we tested. That’s significantly better than all of its competitors (thank the turbo four versus its rivals’ V6 engines). And while real-world driving usually doesn’t match EPA figures, we hit 21.3 mpg in our week of testing. \n\n__Refined.__ Despite the fact that this isn’t entirely a new model (globally), it’s certainly the most refined of any of the midsize trucks on the market (with the exception of the Honda Ridgeline truck thing). Road and wind noise were virtually non-existent and the ride quality was composed and comfortable. It would be an easy pick as a comfortable daily-driver that’s on par with a crossover or SUV, something we’re not sure we’d say about the Tacoma or Colorado. \n\n![060 RANGER 352-ad-1g](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4hAg1w0b1pYIQ2ABeX9LmP/d38e5880b1b6625705d99d9b7353bb22/060_RANGER_352-ad-1g.jpg) \n\n__Good visibility.__ Unlike its rivals (again, with the exception of Honda’s Ridgeline), the Ranger’s cabin has great outward visibility and doesn’t feel like you’re hunkered down in a cramped, dark bunker. As with its refinement, this helped the Ranger feel like an easy pick to use on a daily basis...not just when you need to do truck stuff.  \n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n---\n\n## What’s bad\n*TLDR: Small rear seats, no V6, too much plastic*\n\n__Useless rear seats in SuperCab.__ The model we tested was the SuperCab with the six-foot bed. We found the bed length to be perfect (the shorter five-foot setup cuts down the truck’s practicality). But the rear seats in the SuperCab model aren’t that useful to sit on. The seatbacks are straight upright and legroom for adults back there is practically non-existent. It’s a shame the Ranger doesn’t offer BOTH the six-foot bed AND the larger SuperCrew cab pairing like its rivals do. \n\n__No V6.__ Though the EcoBoost turbo four has plenty of power relative to its rivals, it just can’t match the pure grunt that a larger, naturally-aspirated engine can promise. This wasn’t a reason to avoid the Ranger but buyers who are used to the acceleration, sound and behavior of a larger engine will definitely notice the difference. \n\n__Cheapo interior bits.__ This was a minor gripe but there were portions of the Ranger’s interior that relied too heavily on cheap plastic construction, especially for a vehicle that can top $43,000. \n\n\n---\n\n## 5 stars of execution\n\nSafety Features? __NO__\n- Neither NHTSA nor IIHS has crash-tested the new Ranger. \n- But we were disappointed that all trims of the Ranger didn’t come standard with active safety features like its rival Toyota Tacoma offered standard. These include pre-collision alerts and braking, lane-keep assist and adaptive cruise control. \n- Ford does offer a suite of a few systems -- called CoPilot360 -- as standard on the XLT and Lariat trims and optional on the XL. It includes cross-traffic alerts, blind-spot monitoring and pre-collision alerts. \n\nValue? __NO__\n- The Ranger we tested -- a 4x2 XLT SuperCab -- had a window sticker of just over $38,000. That’s too much money for this setup.\n- For that kind of cash we’d at least expect 4x4 and or the full four-door setup of the SuperCrew. \n\n![059 RANGER 352-ab-1f](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5no7uWQbeKbDLH754rjHuu/d0ac9de4fee99b1290af9c0126571c03/059_RANGER_352-ab-1f.jpg) \n\nEfficiency? __YES__\n- As we mentioned, the Ranger easily beats its V6 rivals in fuel economy. \n- This win applies both to its on-paper EPA ratings as well as its real-world results. \n\nDriving experience? __YES__\n- The Ranger is an excellent daily driver, whether you need the bed in the back or not. \n- Its interior refinement, ride quality and healthy (albeit turbocharged) engine power all add up to an experience that’s enjoyable and -- at times -- non-truck-like. \n\nExecution? __YES__\n- Ford knows trucks; it sells more of the larger F-Series in the U.S. each year than any other vehicle -- by a large margin. So it’s no surprise that even though this Ranger was designed in and for other markets, it shines here in the U.S. \n- Though we were put off by the sticker price, nearly every other attribute of this truck beats its rivals, no small feat considering how accomplished the Tacoma and Colorado are. \n\n##  Total Rating: 3 stars\n\n---\n\n![005 RANGER 90A0007](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5ielrfIb4UaSVIAQVBkRJp/9df8ffffdae9c160a9f875b2923e1de1/005_RANGER__90A0007.jpg) \n\n\n## What’s it gonna cost me?\nThe Ranger starts at $25,495 for a base __XL__ model with a 4x2 powertrain, SuperCab setup (smaller rear seats and doors) and a six-foot bed. \n\nStandard features include a wifi hotspot, Ford’s Sync infotainment system (minus navigation) pre-collision assist and automatic emergency braking, and 16-inch steel wheels. \n\nThe __Ranger XLT__ starts at $29,315 for the 4x2 and the SuperCab setup. This trim adds color-keyed bumpers, 17-inch alloy wheels, parking sensors, fog lights, a power locking tailgate, 4.2-inch digital instrument panel, keyless entry, and the aforementioned active safety tech (blind-spot monitoring, cross-traffic alert, lane-keep assist and pre-collision alerts and braking).\n\nThe top-end __Lariat__ starts at $33,585 for the 4x2 and SuperCab. It adds leather seats, LED headlights and taillights, Ford’s newer Sync 3 infotainment system with an eight-inch touchscreen, unique exterior trim, larger 18-inch alloy wheels and eight-way power front seats that are heated. \n\nThe 4x4 system adds $4,000 to all models while the SuperCrew upgrade runs between $2,100 and $2,400 more than the SuperCab, depending on the trim level. \n\nThe FX4 off-road package can be added to any 4x4 model and costs $1,295. It upgrades the suspension, 17- or 18-inch wheels, and adds an electronic locking rear differential, skid plates, unique display in instrument panel and a terrain management system.\n\n![19 FRD RGR 41201 XL-STX-FX4-Super-Cab](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2cehyuDrxT6mGJrDAJIQay/ca6c380ff44fd28107b53ffaffe756fb/19_FRD_RGR_41201_XL-STX-FX4-Super-Cab.jpg) \n\nIf it were our money on the line, we’d opt for the base __XL__ 4x4 SuperCrew model and then we’d add the __FX4__ package and the __STX__ package. For $35,480, it gives you a handsome, capable truck with all the refinement that we love on the Ranger and none of the expensive fluff. \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n---\n\n## Also consider\nThe Ranger is in a small but competitive class of midsize trucks that really has no losers. \n\nThe Toyota Tacoma is an excellent all-arounder, mixing capability, iconic reliability and comfort; no wonder it’s the segment’s top seller. We’d gladly buy one. \n\nThe Chevy Colorado is also a strong contender, doing everything the Toyota does, just not as well. The GMC Canyon is its slightly upscale cousin. \n\nFinally, Nissan’s Frontier is the oldest of the group, soldiering on in its general configuration for more than a decade. Despite this age, it still represents a strong value in the midsize truck space that buyers should consider. \n\n","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Review","ford","ranger","midsize pickup","pickup","truck","chevrolet colorado","toyota tacoma","4x4"],"ctaText":"Browse Ranger Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/ford-ranger#year_min=2019\u0026year_max=2019","modified_date":"2019-05-17T21:56:08.498Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4ctaawOeBU3aQt5EZwcPU4/b91cc0328a89e184fb7e8ff277d8b24f/2019-toyota-camry-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1JrlBY0CSHb55dLRrQHKWK/35cc4b4a4fe914209ce470670583ad27/2019-toyota-camry-325-image.jpg","slug":"2019-toyota-camry-review","title":"2019 Toyota Camry Review","publication_date":"2019-05-16T11:39-08:00","content_summary":"The 2019 Toyota Camry is a safe, reliable and fuel efficient midsize sedan which makes it the perfect car for professionals, families and older drivers.

There are considerable differences in the interior materials used depending on which trim level is selected. All versions of this year’s edition are comfortable and enjoyable to ride in for most passengers. \n\nThe dashboard of the 2019 Toyota Camry features an asymmetrical design emphasized by sweeping lines and curves which help to convey a more upmarket, luxurious feel. Depending on which trim level is selected, the interior design of this year’s Camry.\n\nThis 2019 model comfortably seats five people, though taller passengers may feel slightly cramped in the backseat. the interior of the Camry is well designed for its primary purpose as a high-use family-friendly car. \n\nWhen compared to competitors [Honda Accord](https://www.autolist.com/honda-accord), [Mazda6](https://www.autolist.com/mazda-mazda6), and [Altima](https://www.autolist.com/nissan-altima), the Toyota Camry has slightly less headroom in the front seat. In the backseat, this year’s model has more headroom. Compared to the [Accord](https://www.autolist.com/honda-accord), [Mazda6](https://www.autolist.com/mazda-mazda6) and [Altima](https://www.autolist.com/nissan-altima), the Camry has less legroom in the backseat, though most reviewers affirm that the riding difference is negligible. \n\n![2019-toyota-camry-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6GhJKH9O5AM5ngbvg9iQ2r/588b858b9596b2b932d27083c54bbe98/2019-toyota-camry-interior2.jpg)\n\nThe Toyota Camry is one of America’s best selling cars in great part due to the comfort and space previous generations have offered. The latest version is in no way a departure from this tradition and is likely to feel just right for a great number of drivers.  \n\nThe Camry is outfitted with 2 sets of LATCH car seat connectors and has earned the highest possible rating for ease of use from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Some reviewers have found the interior of the 2019 Camry to be noisy when compared to other models in the midsize family sedan category. \n\nThis Camry features clear and easy to understand gauges, buttons and screens, making the car simple and intuitive to drive or ride in as a passenger. \n\nIn keeping with past generations, the 2019 Toyota Camry has a generous trunk cargo capacity of 15.1 cubic feet of space. This matches up higher than the Mazda6's 14.7 cubic feet, though less than the Accord or Altima which have 16.7 cubic feet and 15.4 cubic feet of cargo space respectively.  \n\nThis car offers ample legroom for passengers taller than six feet. Much taller riders may find the Toyota Camry does not offer the headspace necessary for a comfortable ride. \n\n### Utility \u0026 Practicality\n\nDesigned to carry more than 12 filled shopping bags in its 15 feet of cubic storage space, the 2019 Toyota Camry is well suited for practical, everyday use by busy professionals and families. \n\nWith an above-average reliability rating of 4 out of 5 stars from J.D. Power and Associates, the Camry was designed to offer considerable utility. \n\nAll Toyotas come with a three-year, 36,000-mile basic warranty, a five-year, 60,000 mile powertrain warranty and a five-year, unlimited-mile corrosion perforation warranty. The brand is consistently ranked one of the world’s most reliable cars and with more than 10 million Camry’s already sold, Toyota clearly has a successful track record. \n\nThe 2019 Toyota Camry is built to last and is among the most practical cars available on the market today.  \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Technology \u0026 Infotainment\n\nNew for 2019, all Camry’s now come standard with Apple CarPlay and Amazon Alexa in addition to a seven-inch touch screen, USB port, Siri Eyes Free, Bluetooth, mobile Wi-Fi hotspot and a six-speaker audio system. \n\nThis car can be upgraded to include features like wireless smartphone charging, a moonroof, two additional USB ports, an updated infotainment system with eight-inch touch screen and a nine-speaker JBL audio system. \n\n![2019-toyota-camry-interior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6yjvkZYsMECHIE8ACUsJIP/7a7266f95fcfee1634d0d1ef8c663171/2019-toyota-camry-interior1.jpg)\n\nThe Camry’s Entune Infotainment system includes an updated touch screen features a bright and highly responsive design that is easy for users of all ages to operate. \n\nThe car also offers a well-designed suite of technologies to boost driver assistance and safety as well as entertainment. When compared to other models in the family midsize category, the Camry earns high marks for its innovative use of helpful technologies that improve the driving experience. \n\n### Safety \u0026 Driving Assistance\n\nThe Camry is loaded with safety features such as blind spot monitoring, a rear cross traffic alert system, automatic rearward braking, a heads up display and 360-degree camera. In 2019, this car earned a perfect 5-star highway crash test rating from the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration. \n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awarded the Camry the highest possible rating of “good” in six individual crash tests. The car was also named by this organization as a 2019 Top Safety Pick +. \n\nWhen compared to competitors the [Accord](https://www.autolist.com/honda-accord), [Mazda6](https://www.autolist.com/mazda-mazda6), and [Altima](https://www.autolist.com/nissan-altima), the 2019 Toyota Camry is the only one to earn the coveted “+” designation. The main reason for this additional safety accolade is the car’s impressive headlights which are among the absolute best in the category of midsize sedans. \n\nSafety is one of the main selling points of the new Camry. Every model comes with Toyota Safety Sense P as a standard feature. This pre-collision awareness suite offers pedestrian detection, lane departure alert with steering assist, automatic high beams and a dynamic radar adaptive cruise control system, \n\n### Driving Experience\n\nSurprisingly nimble and sporty, the front wheel drive Toyota Camry delivers an impressively responsive driving experience. More agile than its competitors, this car handles sharp turns and intense braking situations with ease. \n\nBoth the standard 2.5-liter, four-cylinder engine with 203-horsepower and the 301-horsepower, 3.5-liter V6 versions handle well and make for an enjoyable car for normal, everyday use.  The V6 engine offers 267 pounds of torque which is far higher than competitors such as the [Accord](https://www.autolist.com/honda-accord), [Mazda6](https://www.autolist.com/mazda-mazda6) or [Altima](https://www.autolist.com/nissan-altima). \n\nCamrys with the base four-cylinder will do 0-60 miles per hour in 7.9 seconds. While traveling at 60 miles per hour, it is able to come to a complete stop in 122 feet. \n\nWhen turning at high speed, the Toyota Camry offers firm and agile handling. The SE editions of this car offer a sportier feel without reducing onboard comfort or safety features. \n\nThe newest Camry offers a smooth and enjoyable driving experience which is likely to inspire and invigorate drivers who may have written previous generations of this car off. The 2019 Camry performs well and offers an enjoyable driving experience well suited for hectic urban environments or cruising on long distance highway trips.  \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Fuel efficiency\n\nThe 2019 Toyota Camry is one of the most fuel-efficient non-hybrid cars available on the market today. This car will easily deliver 29 miles per gallon in the city and up to 41 on the highway. \n\nDrivers who opt for the 301 horsepower V6 Camry will see quicker acceleration at the expense of reduced fuel economy. \n\n### Pricing \u0026 Value\n\nThe 2019 Toyota Camry is available in five trim levels: L, LE, SE, XLE and XSE. There’s also a Camry Hybrid which has been featured in a separate review. \n\nEach of these trim levels offers considerable value despite being priced on the higher end of the midsize sedan category. Reliability, safety and fuel efficiency are the main driving factors ensuring that any 2019 Toyota Camry purchase is likely to be a smart buy. \n\n__Toyota Camry L __\n\nThe Toyota Camry L starts at $23,845. The car includes a 203-horsepower four-cylinder engine, eight-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive plus the Entune infotainment system with seven-inch touch screen, USB port, mobile Wi-Fi hotspot,  Bluetooth, Siri Eyes Free, Apple CarPlay and a six-speaker system.\n\nThe L trim also comes standard with safety features like a rearview camera, lane departure warning, lane-keep assist, automatic high beams, pedestrian detection and adaptive cruise control. \n\n__Toyota Camry LE __\n\nThe Camry LE starts at $24,350 and adds an extra cubic foot of trunk space, a folding rear seat and a power-adjusted driver’s seat. This model also offers upgrades like blind spot monitoring, rear cross traffic alerts and a moonroof. \n\n__Toyota Camry__ \n\nThe Camry SE starts at $25,550 and includes upgrades like climate control and faux leather seats. \n\nThis model can also be upgraded with things like blind spot monitoring, wireless phone charging, rear cross traffic alert, a dual-zone automatic climate control system, and an improved Entune infotainment system featuring an eight-inch touch screen, satellite radio and a high definition radio. \n\n__Toyota Camry XLE__\n\nThe Toyota Camry XLE starts at $28,925. \n\nIt adds to the lower trims things like leather seats, a dual-zone climate control system, heated front seats, blind spot monitoring, wireless smartphone charging, rear cross traffic alert, two extra USB ports and an updated Entune infotainment system with 8-inch touch screen, satellite radio and a high definition radio. \n\nBuyers can add to this model things like navigation, a heads up display, a 360-degree camera system, panoramic glass roof, automatic rear braking, and a nine-speaker JBL audio system. \n\nThe 301-horsepower V6 engine is a $5,125 option; the upgrade also adds features like a panoramic roof, a heads up display and nine-speaker JBL audio system. \n\n__Toyota Camry XSE__\n\nThe Camry XSE starts at $29,475 for the four-cylinder model.\n\nThe XSE can also be upgraded to the V6 for $5,125. As with the XSE, models with the V6 also add the panoramic roof, a heads-up display and a nine-speaker JBL audio system.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Sedan","Review"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/toyota-camry#year_min=2019\u0026year_max=2019","modified_date":"2019-05-17T16:59:24.890Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7ByWhiUBpz5TKvtI7cLyTb/a55f0f35948a6bf71637cfb4dddf8310/xt4hero-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/d9ocxle71I1trMvsuJzfZ/fad06370b328ffe1b5c7663b8bdf1159/xt4-thumb-image.jpg","slug":"2019-cadillac-xt4-review","title":"Driven: 2019 Cadillac XT4","publication_date":"2019-05-14T16:00-08:00","content_summary":"Cadillac’s new baby crossover -- the XT4 -- looks good, drives well and is a perfect size.

It’s the luxury brand’s cheapest, entry-level crossover, slotting at the bottom of a growing family of crossovers and SUVs that includes the XT5, the also-new XT6 and the Escalade. \n\nThe XT4 competes in one of the hottest segments in the luxury industry and counts as rivals the Lexus NX, Acura RDX, BMW X1, Audi Q3, Mercedes GLA, Volvo XC40, Land Rover Discovery Sport and Evoque, Jaguar E-Pace and Lincoln MKC and Corsair.\n\nThe XT4 comes with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine with 237 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. It’s paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission and standard front-wheel-drive. \n\nThe XT4 starts at $35,790 for the FWD base model, which Cadillac calls the Luxury trim. \n\nBuyers can also choose two optional trim levels: the Premium Luxury or the Sport, both of which start at the same price point ($42,790). \n\nAll-wheel-drive is a $2,500 option on all trim levels. \n\n---\n\n## What’s good\n*TLDR: Sized right, plenty of oomph, great infotainment.*\n\n![2019-Cadillac-XT4-067](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7K9GPZrCq01FiOlSpROdb3/a074e55a0746483038aabf472d4a53cd/2019-Cadillac-XT4-067.jpg) \n\n\n__Infotainment system.__ Numerous new General Motors’ vehicles are now rolling out with excellent touchscreen infotainment and navigation systems and this includes the XT4. The screen is bright, the menus are intuitive and the systems are quick. \n\n__Power!__ Like nearly all of its competitors, the XT4 comes with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine. But unlike some of its peers, this engine never feels underpowered or like it’s working too hard to move the car. Plus the engine plays nice with the standard nine-speed automatic transmission for a reliably smooth and refined experience. \n\n__Nice size.__ The XT4 is a great size -- big enough to carry four adults in comfort with room for their luggage yet small enough to park easily and maneuever into and out of tight spots.\n\n\n![2019-Cadillac-XT4-066](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/AhHIlSBv55FHoLQjEpl2i/af3a865e7c33af74b620019faa21201e/2019-Cadillac-XT4-066.jpg)\n\n---\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n## What’s bad\n*TLDR: Not enough vehicle for the money.*\n\n__Lack of safety features.__ Adaptive cruise control? Pre-collision alerts or braking? Blind spot monitoring? All missing from the base XT4. Not optional, mind you, but missing entirely from the options sheet. You can’t add them if you want to. That’s a crucial oversight when nearly all of the XT’s competitors at least offer these features and many of its rivals make said features standard. \n\n\n__Expensive.__ Our loaded test models had window stickers of around $56,000. Not only is that a lot of money in the first place, but those many dollars didn’t add anything special that made the price tag seem remotely reasonable. Moonroof, power liftgate, active safety features -- even heated seats are all optional on the XT4 and standard on many of its peers.\n\n__Cheap interior bits.__ Despite competing in the luxury space, the XT4 relies too heavily on cheap plastic panels in parts of the interior. In addition, some of the vehicle’s switchgear also uses plastic that feels subpar, especially when compared to what brands like BMW, Audi and even Acura are doing with their interiors. \n\n---\n\n## 5 stars of execution\n\nSafety Features? __NO__\n- The XT4 has an impressive five-star safety rating from the NHTSA; the independent IIHS hasn’t crash-tested this crossover yet. \n- But active safety features -- things like adaptive cruise control, pre-collision alert and braking and blind spot monitoring are optional on the higher XT4 trims and not even offered on the base model. This is a key oversight, as many of its competitors offer these features as standard on all trims. \n\n\nValue? __NO__\n- While the starting price of the XT4 is in line with many of its peers, reasonable options that should be standard end up adding way too much to the XT4’s sticker price. \n- Things like a sunroof, active safety features, a navigation system, power liftgate and heated front seats can push the XT4’s price to the mid $50,000 range, which is far too high for a vehicle of this caliber. \n- Making matters worse is the materials (hard plastics) that Cadillac uses inside the XT4 are subpar for a luxury vehicle. \n\n![2019-Cadillac-XT4-070](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4Am0DvqgJ7JNuinfLqmbTf/834d7e207ac8107c179dbb070bb77a80/2019-Cadillac-XT4-070.jpg) \n\n\n\nEfficiency? __YES__\n- The XT4 doesn’t break the mold when it comes to fuel efficiency but it is competitive with its rivals. \n- The AWD model we tested is rated by the EPA at 22/29/24 city/highway/combined, on par with the average efficiency for the segment. \n\nDriving experience? __YES__\n- The powertrain was our favorite part of the XT4.\n- While it uses a turbocharged four-cylinder like many of its peers, it feels conspicuously stronger and more powerful than rivals, with no noticeable turbo lag. \n- The engine and transmission also work seamlessly together. \n\n\n![2019-Cadillac-XT4-128](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3ReIUM4Z2NWWM0K9X9d5N1/12a6b8ca4cf8a9f976446ef7655cee25/2019-Cadillac-XT4-128.jpg)\n\n\nExecution? __NO__\n- The XT4 certainly has its strengths, notably its powertrain and a nice dash of interior styling and a fast-acting and intuitive infotainment system. \n- But cheap plastics inside, a lack of standard features (safety and otherwise) and an inflated price tag make this a hard sell. \n- The XT4 plays in one of the most competitive luxury segments and it’s clearly outgunned here by most of its peers. \n\n##  Total Rating: 2 stars\n\n---\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n## What’s it gonna cost me?\nThe XT4 starts at $35,790 for the base Luxury trim. That gets you the turbocharged, four-cylinder engine paired with the nine-speed automatic transmission, front-wheel-drive, faux leather seats, eight-inch touchscreen infotainment system (without nav but with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Bluetooth connectivity), a seven-speaker audio system, power front seats, multiple driving modes, 18-inch alloy wheels, rear parking sensors and LED headlamps and taillamps.\n\nThe Premium Luxury and Sport trims each start at $40,290 for the front-wheel-drive trim. \n\nAll-wheel-drive is a $2,500 option on all trims. \n\nThe Premium Luxury model adds leather seats, front parking sensors, lane-change alert with blind spot monitoring, rear cross traffic alert, a power liftgate and the availability of options that aren’t offered on the base Luxury trim. \n\n\n![2019-Cadillac-XT4-119](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6EzU4yaTmxB1XJynXTEwqo/85359034822b6ec98ebc31ef3168e7f1/2019-Cadillac-XT4-119.jpg) \n\n\nThe Sport model includes mostly cosmetic changes to the Premium Luxury trim including unique 18-inch alloy wheels, body-color and gloss black exterior trim, a unique grille, carbon fiber or wood interior trim and a sport steering wheel. \n\n---\n\n## Also consider\nAs we mentioned, the XT4 is in one of the most competitive segments in the luxury space: compact crossovers. Thus, there are a ton of excellent options, most of which we’d recommend over this Cadillac. \n\nKey models to consider include the BMW X1, Acura RDX, Lexus NX and Volvo XC40.\n\nWe’d skip the Mercedes GLA, Infiniti QX30 and Range Rover Discovery Sport.\n\nWe have yet to test the new Audi Q3, Range Rover Evoque, Jaguar E-Pace and Lincoln Corsair (replacement for the MKC). \n","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Review","CUV"],"ctaText":"Browse XT4 Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/cadillac-xt4#year_min=2019\u0026year_max=2019","modified_date":"2019-05-15T20:54:09.651Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7zM1jbVEtAVIHmlQMl2QqY/e298f4d3b9fb234bb1b0179f72ebd3f1/2019-range-rover-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7FvxAb9FH6zYj4sQQaYvgW/9f7886e7c9d443257cc92a100262d8e3/2019-range-rover-325-image.jpg","slug":"2019-range-rover-review","title":"2019 Range Rover Review","publication_date":"2019-05-13T06:03-08:00","content_summary":"The Land Rover Range Rover is a large British luxury SUV that competes with the Toyota Land Cruiser, Lincoln Navigator, Mercedes GLS-Class, and Infiniti QX80.","parent_page":{"name":"Guides","description":"Guides","slug":"guides"},"categories":[{"name":"Car Review","description":"Autolist Car Review","parentCategory":{"name":"Reviews","description":"Reviews"}}],"category":{"name":"Car Review","description":"Autolist Car Review","parentCategory":{"name":"Reviews","description":"Reviews"}},"author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"body":"### Summary\n\nThe 2019 Land Rover Range Rover is a large made luxury SUV which is now in its fourth generation of production.  \n\nIt competes in a high-end segment of SUVs which include the [Lincoln Navigator](https://www.autolist.com/lincoln-navigator), [Toyota Land Cruiser](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-land+cruiser), [Cadillac Escalade](https://www.autolist.com/cadillac-escalade), [Mercedes Benz GLS Class](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes+benz-gl+class), Lexus LX, [Infiniti QX80](https://www.autolist.com/new-infiniti-qx80), [BMW](https://www.autolist.com/bmw) X7, and [Mercedes G Class](https://www.autolist.com/mercedes+benz-g+class).  \n\nThe lone new feature for the 2019 Range Rover is a new plug-in hybrid powertrain option which adds a reported 31 miles of all electric range.  \n\nThe Range Rover is an iconic British vehicle, co-owned by Jaguar, with a world-renown combination of luxury and off-road capability. Options are plentiful, its design is handsome, and performance isn’t lacking for Land Rover’s flagship model.  \n\nNot to be confused with its sibling, the [Land Rover Range Rover Sport](https://www.autolist.com/land+rover-range+rover+sport), the Range Rover is larger, more expensive, and more luxurious. The [Range Rover Sport](https://www.autolist.com/land+rover-range+rover+sport) SVR is also more performance-oriented than its big brother.  \n\n### Exterior\n\nThe Range Rover is large with a tall cabin and a commanding road presence.  \n\nSimilarly to the [Land Rover Ranger Rover Sport](https://www.autolist.com/land+rover-range+rover+sport), it does not look as off-road capable as it really is. Large 20-inch wheels fill out the wheel wells nicely and make it look sporty and athletic.  \n\n![2019-range-rover-exterior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/h8crmslBHp0oFKZ9pHbxw/6befdff3bfe02b15767121c158c4993d/2019-range-rover-exterior1.jpg)\n\nThe front is nicely rounded like it sibling, the [Range Rover Velar](https://www.autolist.com/land+rover-range+rover+velar), while the character lines flow back across the body making it almost look wind-swept. It doesn’t look mean nor does it have sharp lines like many modern vehicles. It also doesn’t appear lumpy or generic.  \n\nA long wheelbase version of the Range Rover is available which makes it look even larger than the standard wheelbase SUV.  \n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort\n\nInterior quality is second to none, though some reviewers said the overall styling was bland and uninteresting compared to the competition.  \n\nThe Range Rover is both superior and inferior in terms of interior space and seating. It doesn’t offer a third row like many of its competitors, but that allows for more overall space everywhere else.  \n\n![2019-range-rover-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5HTqHGawnN918BV5Ay2AFw/f3385e4a8541faf7d4f3a579a5719cc2/2019-range-rover-interior2.jpg)\n\nOne reviewer notes that three adults could comfortably sit in the rear seats, especially when opting for the long wheelbase version which adds more than seven inches of leg room for the rear passengers. Both front seats and rear seats are noted to be extremely comfortable and supportive.  \n\nRide comfort is a noted plus with Land Rover’s adaptive air suspension system smoothing out most road impurities. The large wheels are said to cause more than desired road noise, but that the ride is still quieter than most.  \n\n### Utility \u0026 Practicality\n\nUtility is where the Range Rover shines the most.  \n\nIt is well suited for city, country, and off-road driving. Offering a combination of comfort, sportiness, and true off-road capability from its permanent 4-wheel drive and terrain response selection systems, it is unrivaled in terms of its all-around capability.  \n\nCargo space is large because of Range Rover’s size but is small compared to others in the segment. It offers 68.6 cubic feet of cargo room when the rear seats are folded down and an additional 7 cubic feet of space for the long wheelbase model.  \n\n![2019-range-rover-exterior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7yb6VWxyrswcZ5cqiDcbKT/32b4f8428498dd93a0b6fa112fc83e92/2019-range-rover-exterior2.jpg)\n\nAn Executive Class Seating Package is an option which offers more rear legroom and luxury seating options but less storage in the cargo area. Space is cut to 24.5 cubic feet.  \n\nAlmost 32 cubic feet of space is offered when the rear seats are in their upright position.  \n\nA LATCH child safety seat system is equipped on both rear seats for added practicality.  \n\nCubbies and storage pockets are present throughout the cabin for smaller items.  \n\nLoading items into the cargo deck is made easy by the split tailgate which is also power and gesture operated. The advanced suspension system can even lower the Range Rover for an easier load height.  \n\nTowing capability is strong at a maximum of just over 7500 pounds.  \n\nThough practicality is reduced for lack of a third row seating option, the second row seats are spacious and comfortable, even for a family of five.  \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Technology \u0026 Infotainment\n\nThe Range Rover is abundant in technology features, but reviewers generally didn’t like the Touch Pro Duo touchscreen infotainment system.  \n\nMany said it was too complicated, not as responsive as other competitors’ systems, and outdated. Despite this, the infotainment system consists of two, 10-inch touchscreens and is highly configurable.  \n\nA 13-speaker Meridian Sound System is standard with 19 and 29 speaker upgrades available. HD radio, satellite radio, Bluetooth, climate and radio controls, a navigation system, and a Wi-Fi hot spot are all accessible through the system.  \n\n![2019-range-rover-interior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2xDSnqjUsZ6pbNtiIOdfai/0ecab49633f80a9403c8f18ed30a4a4a/2019-range-rover-interior1.jpg)\n\nStandout technology options include quad-zone climate control, road sign recognition system, a 360-degree view camera, and the Land Rover Activity Key. The Activity Key is similar to a smartwatch and functions like a regular keyless entry system.  \n\nThe new 2019 plug-in hybrid powertrain ensures that the Range Rover stays relevant in an increasingly hybrid-heavy market.  \n\nAn advanced four-wheel drive system rather than an all-wheel drive system gives the Range Rover its incredible ability to cross terrain that no other SUV can.  \n\n### Safety \u0026 Driving Assistance\n\nThough the 2019 Range Rover has not yet been crash tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, it does come standard with a large amount of driver assistance technology.  \n\nForward collision warning, a rear camera, front and rear parking sensors, lane departure warning, and automatic emergency braking are all standard equipment.  \n\nOptional safety equipment includes almost every available safety system available on the market today.  \n\nRear cross-traffic alert, a heads up display, a parking assist system, driver drowsiness monitor, adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitoring, lane keep assist, and an exit monitoring system are all available.  \n\n### Driving Experience\n\nReviewers of the Range Rover are not surprised by the great ride quality, off-road capability, and excellent range of engine options.  \n\nLand Rover offers six engine options, all paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. All reviewers thought each engine delivered good power and acceleration, but the V8 engine options outshone the rest according to those who drove the vehicle.  \n\nThe base supercharged 3.0 liter V6 engine produces 340 horsepower and 332 lb-ft. of torque.  \n\nThe same supercharged V6 engine is offered with an increased 380 horsepower and 332 lb-ft. of torque for those who want more power.  \n\nA 3.0 liter turbodiesel V6 engine, or TD6 , is offered with 254 horsepower and 443 lb-ft. of torque.  \n\nThe supercharged 5.0 liter base V8 engine produces 518 horsepower and 461 lb-ft. of torque.  \n\nThe same supercharged 5.0 liter V8 engine is available with an upgraded 557 horsepower.  \n\nThe new plug in hybrid powertrain, called the P400e by Land Rover, features a 2.0 liter turbocharged four cylinder engine which produces 398 horsepower when combined with its electric motor.  \n\nAll engine options are paired to an 8-speed automatic transmission.  \n\nTesters universally praise the driving experience of the Range Rover regardless of the engine option. All are surprised by the quickness of the hybrid and diesel powertrain options.  \n\nAll testers are also completely satisfied with the Range Rovers V6 engines, citing them as competitive with the rest of the segment’s predominantly V8 engines.  \n\nHandling is noted to be solid with little body roll and confidence during cornering. Maneuverability is also a plus with reviewers. The Range Rover is large but feels smaller due to its tight turning radius and nimble steering feel.  \n\nTesters mentioned the “sport mode” provides a snappier feel when accelerating and cornering.  \n\nAcceleration is noted to be stellar, especially with the V8 engines propelling the three ton SUV to 60 miles per hour in under five seconds.  \n\nBraking is also good with a solid feel throughout the pedal travel.  \n\n### Fuel efficiency\n\nThe Range Rover excels in fuel economy, because it offers two V6 engine choices and a turbodiesel engine.  \n\nThe new PHEV plug in hybrid hasn’t been awarded EPA figures as of yet, so the 3.0 liter turbodiesel V6 engine gets the best fuel economy with 22 miles per gallon in the city and 28 miles per gallon on the highway.  \n\nThe base 3.0 liter supercharged V6 engine earns a respectable EPA estimate of 17 miles per gallon in the city and 23 miles per gallon on the highway for a combined 19 miles per gallon.  \n\nCompared to the [Cadillac Escalade](https://www.autolist.com/cadillac-escalade) with a combined 17 miles per gallon, the [Toyota Land Cruiser](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-land+cruiser) with a combined 15 miles per gallon, and the [Lincoln Navigator](https://www.autolist.com/lincoln-navigator) with a combined 18 miles per gallon, the Land Rover does better than average for the segment.  \n\nThe BMW X7 gets slightly better gas mileage with EPA estimates of 20 and 25 miles per gallon in city and highway driving respectively.  \n\nStepping up to the V8 engine options will decrease fuel efficiency significantly.  \n\nThe top-performing 557 horsepower V8 engine provides an EPA estimated 16 miles combined city and highway driving.  \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Pricing \u0026 Value\n\nWith as much performance as the Range Rover has, and for as well-rounded of a vehicle as testers claim, it has a much higher price tag than many of its competitors. Fully loaded, a top-of-the-line Range Rover can cost well over $200,000.  \n\nThe price tag makes the Range Rover not as good a value as others in the segment like the [Lincoln Navigator](https://www.autolist.com/lincoln-navigator) and [Toyota Land Cruiser](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-land+cruiser).  \n\nWith a starting price at just under $90,000, the Range Rover is $5000 more than a base Land Cruiser with third row seating, greater towing capability, and greater reported reliability.  \n\nThe [Lincoln Navigator](https://www.autolist.com/lincoln-navigator) starts at just over $73,000 MSRP, a sizeable $16,500 price difference.  \n\nAll Range Rover trims come standard with a full time four-wheel drive system, terrain management system with Hill Descent Control, leather interior, power liftgate, and the Touch Pro Duo touchscreen infotainment system featuring two 10-inch touchscreens.  \n\nStandard safety features include lane departure warning, front and rear parking sensors, and a rearview camera.  \n\nThe Land Rover Range Rover is available in six different trim options:  \n\n__Land Rover Range Rover Base__\n\nThe base model Land Rover Range Rover is equipped with the base 3.0 liter supercharged V6 engine.  \n\nPricing starts at slightly less than $91,000 with destination included.  \n\nAll V6 and V8 engine options are available for the base trim but will cost extra, including the turbodiesel V6.  \n\nAdditional safety features you can add to the base Range Rover include driver drowsiness monitor, adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitoring, head up display, and 360-degree view camera. A rear seat entertainment option is also available.  \n\n__Land Rover Range Rover __\n\nThe Range Rover HSE starts at just under $96,000 with destination included. It is the only trim available with which to add the new PHEV plug in hybrid powertrain option, an $1100 upgrade from the base 3.0 liter supercharged V6 engine.  \n\nThe HSE includes technology features such as heated steering wheel and rear seats, a panoramic sunroof, and upgraded 20-inch wheels.  \n\nStandard safety features include driver drowsiness monitor, road sign recognition system, and a 360 degree view camera.  \n\nOptional extras include an upgraded 19-speaker audio system and a rear seat entertainment system.  \n\nOptional safety equipment include the same as the base Range Rover with the addition of road sign recognition, parking assist, and lane keep assist.  \n\n__Land Rover Range Rover Supercharged__\n\nThe Range Rover Supercharged is the lowest trim level that comes standard with the supercharged 5.0 liter V8 engine.

It was introduced in 2004 replacing the popular S-10 compact pickup truck. The Colorado competes with the [Ford Ranger](https://www.autolist.com/ford-ranger), [GMC Canyon](https://www.autolist.com/gmc-canyon), [Honda Ridgeline](https://www.autolist.com/honda-ridgeline), [Nissan Frontier](https://www.autolist.com/nissan-frontier) and the [Toyota Tacoma](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-tacoma). It appeals to new truck buyers who want a pick-up with a car-like interior feel, rear-wheel drive and four-wheel drive capable of towing a lot of weight. The 2019 model is part of the second generation Colorado first released for the 2015 model year. New in 2019 is Chevy's infotainment system  includes a 7-inch color touchscreen and a rear view camera. The Colorado is available in five different trim levels, base, WT (work truck), LT, Z71 and the ColoradoZR2. The base model price begins at $22,395 while the ZR2 trim model starts at $44,390 including destination fee before adding packages and additional options. \n\n### Exterior\n\nThe Colorado has a sporty look for a pickup truck. Despite its smaller size you can see the family resemblance to the bigger full-size Silverado, [Tahoe](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-tahoe) and [Suburban](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-suburban). The headlamps are a large single unit which contributes to the very clean looking front end. The exterior body styles range from very simple and basic to aggressive and bold.  The base Colorado model is equipped with automatic on/off headlights, standard silver 16-inch steel wheels, a locking tailgate which uses the same key as the ignition and the option of a short 61-inch bed or an extended 74-inch bed, cab options are extended cab or crew cab. The higher up you go on the trim levels the more exterior features are available. On the LT trim level the Colorado is upgraded with 17-inch aluminum wheels and body-colored rear bumper, mirror caps and door handles. On the Z71 trim the 17-inch wheels are upgraded with a unique paint job, paired with all-terrain tires. The front bumper is now equipped with projector beam headlamps and factory mounted fog lights. Finally on the off-road friendly ZR2 trim level is equipped with an off-road appearance package, the tires are upgraded to aggressive tread patterns specific for off-roading, the hood is upgraded along with the front bumper resized to allow for increased clearance, skid plates and a transfer case shield are standard on this trim as well as the spray-on bed-liner with the ZR2 logo.\n\n![2019-chevrolet-colorado-exterior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7zSzysMHZFxgPTkuNNAhmb/fac101e3eb3b52bf307b148318b5758b/2019-chevrolet-colorado-exterior1.jpg)\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort\n\nThe interior is largely hard plastics, and lower quality surfaces, however assembly is solid and put together well. The front buckets seats are comfortable and allow plenty of headroom although much larger individuals will find the seats a bit too narrow. The standard driver's seat has four-way power and a manual recline handle and are wrapped in high quality durable material, higher trim levels have the option of heated and leather seats. The Colorado sits up pretty high so entering may be difficult for shorter individuals especially as side steps are optional and not standard. On models equipped with a crew cab the rear door is smaller and narrow which makes for difficulty getting in and out, the rear seat leg space is limited and there is inadequate headroom for larger passengers. The base model also includes power windows, air conditioning and two USB ports standard.\n\n![2019-chevrolet-colorado-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/34316za3JvCcUG0Y3QhGqD/c0c427c3650d2109079df7464f2cbe88/2019-chevrolet-colorado-interior2.jpg)\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Utility and Practicality\n\nThe Colorado is the leader of its class in towing, horsepower, and highway mpg depending on which of the 3 available motors you choose. The standard pickup bed is 6-feet long, larger than it competitors. If you choose a crew cab model then the pick up bed shrinks to just over 5 feet long. As far as interior cargo space the Colorado is not the best yet isn't the worst.  \n\n![2019-chevrolet-colorado-exterior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3vrQOEIAsHBxHZlbSiaViZ/e636cce950406bd494576c2933755fe2/2019-chevrolet-colorado-exterior2.jpg)\n\nOf the three available motors is the 4-cylinder 2.8 liter turbo diesel engine that is capable of towing 7,700 pounds and get the best in class 30 mpg highway. The 3.6 liter V6 engine holds the title for most horsepower for its class pumping out 308 horses. Last but not least the 2.5 liter 4-cylinder has a towing capacity of 3,500 pounds. \n\n### Technology and Infotainment\n\nThe base model Chevy Colorado is equipped with a 7-inch color touchscreen paired with bluetooth streaming for compatible devices, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, a 6-speaker sound system and a rear-view camera. \n\n![2019-chevrolet-colorado-interior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2WvMEMrZozhPX9KezOu6O4/ac37a745f3dabd652919d17fbcfd2c0a/2019-chevrolet-colorado-interior1.jpg)\n\nThe Colorado LT trim model and ascending trims receive an 8-inch color touchscreen which features voice recognition an HD rear-view camera, 4G LTE Wi-Fi capable requiring a data subscription and Sirius XM radio which also requires a subscription after its trial period. \n\n### Safety and Driving Assistance\n\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website the Colorado received 4 out of 5 stars overall. In front crash fro both the driver and passenger side the Colorado scored 4 out of 5 stars. In side crash testing the Colorado scored a perfect 5 out of five stars. In the roll over rating category the Colorado received a 3 out of 5 score. \n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) gave the Colorado different ratings based on the options of RWD or 4WD and extended cab or crew cab. The Colorado received a Good rating on all categories except for the frontal passenger side crash. The headlights are rated as poor, and the LATCH system ease of use is rated as marginal. \n\nThe Colorado can also be equipped with Available safety features such as forward collision alert, lane departure warning and rear park assist. \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Driving Experience\n\nThe Chevy Colorado offers 3 different powertrains, beginning with the 2.5 L in-line four-cylinder engine that cranks out 200 horsepower, 191 lb-ft of torque, capable of towing 3,500 pounds and can be paired with either a six-speed manual transmission or a six-speed automatic transmission. Next is the 3.6 liter V6 engine which pumps out 308 horsepower, 275 lb-ft of torque, capable of towing 7,000 pounds which is more than any other V6 in the competition and it is the most powerful V6 in its class. All V6 models are paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission.  Last but not least is the 2.8 liter in-line four-cylinder turbo diesel engine that produces 181 horsepower, best in class 369 lb-ft of torque, capable of towing 7,700 pounds and best in-class 30 mpg highway also paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. \n\nThe acceleration on the four-cylinder motor is sufficient for city driving but reveals it lack of passing power when in need of passing on the highway. \n\nThe V6 is strong and powerful making the truck feel light and nimble. The feeling of nearly instant power when you want it is attributed to the smooth throttle. Shifting on the eight-speed automatic transmission is clean as it matches power proportionately, although at times on level surfaces it may lag in downshifting. \n\nThe turbo diesel motor has more pulling power than any midsize pickup truck. Of the three motors the V6 and the turbo diesel are the most popular but the V6 takes the cake because it offer the best balance of power, towing capability and fuel efficiency. \n\nA firm front end suspension permits the Colorado to minimize body roll and offers impressive handing for a pickup. Despite the many car-like handling attributes the Colorado's light rear-end reminds the driver they are still driving a truck. \n\nSteering feedback is nearly non existent but comfortable and reminiscent of a car rather than a truck, the Colorado also maintains a comfortable on-center feel when driving at highway speeds. \n\nThe Colorado's ride is well dampen by the large tires and feels more comfortable than the majority of its competition and it does well absorbing large bumps in the road. As far as noise and vibration is concerned there is a presence of road wind and engine noise however it should not expected to be as quiet as the Tahoe's cabin.  \n\nBraking in the Colorado is easy and controlled, despite the softening of the pedal under harder braking. For a truck that can tow 7,000 pounds the braking power is adequate. \n\nOff-road capabilities are somewhat stunted on every trim level from the Colorado Z71 and down because of the large lower bumper trim. If removed it will permit much more clearance but is no substitute for the minimalistic front end on the ZR2 which enables maximum clearance and ability with the upgraded off-road suspension, dampening system, driver initiated front and rear-locking differentials. \n\nVisibility in the Colorado is good however large roof pillars create large blindspots, the side mirrors are nicely sized which assists when lane changing. \n\n### Fuel Efficiency\n\nFuel Economy on the Colorado is impressive on any of the powertrain configurations when compared to its competition. There are nine different powertrain configurations, the most fuel efficient is the 2WD 2.8 liter in-line four-cylinder turbo diesel engine which according the Environmental Protection Agency fuel economy website this motor achieves 20 mpg city, 30 mpg highway for a combined total of 23 mpg. The least fuel efficient is the top of the lineup Colorado ZR2 4WD with the 3.6 liter V6 engine achieves 16 mpg city, 18 mpg highway for a combined total of 17 mpg. Compare to the competition. \n\n[Honda Ridgeline](https://www.autolist.com/honda-ridgeline) FWD; 19 mpg city, 26 mpg highway for a combined total of 22 mpg. \n\n[Nissan Frontier](https://www.autolist.com/nissan-frontier) 2WD four-cylinder; 19 mpg city, 23 highway for a combined total of 21 mpg. \n\n[Toyota Tacoma](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-tacoma) 2WD four-cylinder; 20 mpg city, 23 mpg highway for a combined total of 21 mpg. \n\nEach competitor configuration listed above is the most fuel efficient for each model. \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Pricing and Value\n\nThe MSRP for the base model Colorado equipped with the 2.5 liter four-cylinder engine, RWD, six-speed automatic transmission, extended cab and long pickup bed is $22,395 including the $1,095 destination fee before additional packages and options added. \n\nThe Colorado WT (Work truck) with standard 2.5 liter four-cylinder engine and the same six-speed automatic transmission adds carpeted interior flooring, dual rear seats with under seat storage will cost $25,895 including destination before additional packages and options. \n\nThe Colorado LT trim model retains the 2.5 liter four-cylinder engine, automatic transmission, RWD powertrain.

The Encore was new for the 2013 model year and has not had a significant redesign since that time.  \n\nIt competes with other subcompact SUVs like the [Mazda CX-3](https://www.autolist.com/mazda-cx+3), [Hyundai Kona](https://www.autolist.com/hyundai-kona), [Honda HR-V](https://www.autolist.com/honda-hr+v), [Nissan Kicks](https://www.autolist.com/nissan-kicks), [Toyota C-HR](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-c+hr), [Ford EcoSport](https://www.autolist.com/ford-ecosport), [Kia Soul](https://www.autolist.com/kia-soul), and [Subaru Crosstrek](https://www.autolist.com/subaru-xv+crosstrek).  \n\nIts General Motors sibling, the [Chevrolet Trax](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-trax), is built on the same platform as the Encore and also competes with it.  \n\nA new change to the 2019 Buick Encore comes by way of subtracting two of the optional trim levels of the Encore to make the lineup simpler. Options from those trims have been integrated into the other trim levels or have been made optional extras.  \n\nThe only other upgrade for 2019 includes the option to upgrade the Ecotec 1.4 liter turbocharged engine to a more powerful version of itself, giving the Encore some much-needed pep.  \n\nThe Encore goes to great lengths to prioritize luxury and comfort for its buyers. By all accounts, it has succeeded. It does fall behind some of the newest and less expensive competitors in terms of technology, safety features, and price.  \n\nThe Encore exists in a highly competitive and in-demand segment, but it can hold its own. One of the universally praised highlights of the SUV is that its predicted reliability is stronger than most other competitors, a welcome bonus for anybody who would look to buy any vehicle.  \n\n### Exterior \n\nAs expected for the class, the Buick Encore can’t hide its small stature. It looks small because it is small.  \n\n![2019-buick-encore-exterior3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/53EiWoGuIqBXE9bL9eSTYx/e865793fd9f26090614bb412e485ea96/2019-buick-encore-exterior3.jpg)\n\nBecause of that, it also looks slightly awkward with its tall roofline, low 6.5-inch ground clearance, and short front and rear overhangs.  \n\nIts overall shape is slightly bulbous, though it doesn’t look fat. Its rounded edges set it apart from many new vehicles today with sharp, aggressive lines. Styling is conservative yet handsome.  \n\nThe large 18-inch wheels fill out the wheel wells nicely and don’t make it look tipsy, even though it is an SUV with a tall cabin.  \n\nRoof rails come standard on all trim levels of the Encore, which is a welcome addition that is absent in many other new vehicles without adding extra cost.\n\n![2019-buick-encore-exterior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/50ZEljhbFhbqOVw1oOoHGZ/61292c87ba9367b1d831afd83332056a/2019-buick-encore-exterior1.jpg)\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort \n\nInterior quality and comfort are where the Buick Encore shines the brightest.  \n\nReviewers praise the QuietTuning active noise cancellation system which Buick offers as standard on the Encore. It includes features like acoustic-laminated glass, special ride-quiet tires, and additional sound deadening materials throughout the vehicle to keep road and wind noise out.  \n\n![2019-buick-encore-interior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6WAlB6JsKeWYwy0ew9t5TE/2cfc92ffad53254db46b171efde87546/2019-buick-encore-interior1.jpg)\n\nMaterials are noted to be upscale though some knobs, buttons, and switches are also noted to be taken from other vehicles from GM’s various brands.  \n\nRide quality is said to be good as long as more than two people aren’t being transported. That is to be expected in such a small vehicle with such a small engine.  \n\nLegroom is better than average for the class though reviewers note that three full-size adults would not fit well in the rear seats.  \n\nVisibility is said to be good as the upright front seats give a commanding view of just about everything around both the passengers and driver.  \n\nSeating comfort is where the Encore falls short. Almost all reviewers note that the seats have very little support with flat cushions and little to no bolstering, albeit with good lumbar support.  \n\n### Utility \u0026 Practicality  \n\nUtility and Practicality place the Buick Encore in the middle of the pack.  \n\nRear cargo space is more extensive than many competitors such as the [Mazda CX-3](https://www.autolist.com/mazda-cx+3) and [Toyota C-HR](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-c+hr) but is smaller than the [Honda HR-V](https://www.autolist.com/honda-hr+v) and a few others. An additional in-floor cargo area is contained under the load floor.  \n\n![2019-buick-encore-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4xkZMHQMZ2M9I5md1xTL0f/2135b5c087ebf4289d7510b4255ad84d/2019-buick-encore-interior2.jpg)\n\nThe Encore’s overall size prevents it from being truly practical, with a tiny space behind the back seats when in their upright position. They can fold down to reveal 48.4 cubic feet of space, but the process of doing this is rather cumbersome and awkward, as noted by reviewers.  \n\nAdventure-seeking is not in the Encore’s handbook.  \n\n![2019-buick-encore-exterior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1lTZutMJg0wMNXY83hr0JN/4ec974cf9f93ac3d486acf60d09ed7dd/2019-buick-encore-exterior2.jpg)\n\nGround clearance is limited, with the front lip scraping several times throughout reviewers’ test drives. Off-roading capability is also limited, even though the Encore does offer all-wheel-drive.  \n\nGetting people and cargo in and out of the Encore are both said to be reasonably comfortable with a low lift-over and step-in height. Tall doors with wide openings also help.  \n\nA LATCH child safety seat system is standard for the rear seats of the Encore, and there is enough legroom for two regularly-sized adults in a pinch.  \n\nInterior storage is ample with cup holders and storage compartments throughout the cabin.  \n\nAs an urban people-mover, the Buick Encore does well for itself while it is let down by its lack of size, storage, and all-around capability everywhere else.  \n\n### Technology \u0026 Infotainment \n\nTechnology and infotainment offerings are other areas in which the Encore shines.  \n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto are both standard on all trim levels, features that are lacking as standard options in several other competitors.  \n\n![2019-buick-encore-interior3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5lBqo5NNx3SZvLTl3zgKF2/0ff59959e215339341a1f63738622246/2019-buick-encore-interior3.jpg)\n\nBuick’s Intellilink infotainment system, displayed on an 8-inch touchscreen, is praised by reviewers for its straightforward and easy to use layout.  \n\nOnStar is standard on the Encore as it is in most other GM vehicles. A navigation system is also available along with Bluetooth, basic voice controls, and the MyBuick app, which allows essential vehicle functions to be controlled through your smartphone.  \n\nA 7-speaker Bose audio system is available over the standard 6-speaker system.  \n\nRounding out the notable technology features are a proximity keyless entry system, rearview camera, and a 4G LTE hotspot.  \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Safety \u0026 Driving Assistance  \n\nThe National Highway Transportation Safety Board rated the Encore very highly as it did above average in all crash test results, but driver assistance aids are lacking compared to other vehicles in the segment.  \n\nMany safety features available at a lower price point on other competitors are not available on the Encore at all.  Available ones include blind spot monitoring, lane departure warning, forward collision warning, rear cross-traffic alert, and parking sensors. Some of these are available only on the highest trim levels of the Encore.  \n\nAdaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, a 360-degree-view camera, and automatic emergency braking are all excluded from the list of available driver assistance features.  \n\nOther standard safety features include electronic stability control, advanced airbags, and traction control.  \n\n### Driving Experience \n\nReviewers note that the overall driving experience of the Encore is neither stellar nor abysmal.  \n\nHigh points of the driving experience include a surprising amount of nimbleness, a much-needed power boost from the upgraded 1.4-liter turbocharged engine, and a smooth six-speed automatic transmission.  \n\nTwo engine options are available on all trim levels of the Buick Encore, both of which are mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission:  \n\nA 1.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine is offered with 138 horsepower and 148 lb-ft. of torque.  \n\nThe same 1.4-liter turbocharged engine can be had on higher trim levels and produces 153 horsepower and 177 lb-ft. of torque.  \n\nReviewers note that the upgraded engine option provides the much-needed power that the original engine did not. It is still not fast, but it will get the job done better than the lower output engine.  \n\nAcceleration is slow, even for a small SUV, with a 9.1 second 0-60 mile per hour time.  \n\nReviewers say that responsive steering feel is really what gives the Encore a feeling of nimbleness, even though the vehicle doesn’t handle particularly well.  \n\nTesters say that cornering provides a mixed bag of handling impressions. The Encore is said to feel top-heavy at times but never feels out of control.  \n\nBraking feel is noted to be overly touchy with an uninspiring overall feel. Despite this, the braking statistics indicate sufficient stopping times with a 126-foot stopping distance from 40 miles per hour. This is average for the class.  \n\n### Fuel efficiency\n\nIn terms of fuel economy, the Buick Encore falls to the middle of the pack.  \n\nWhen equipped with front-wheel drive and the base 1.4-liter engine with 138 horsepower, the Encore gets an EPA estimated 27 miles per gallon in city driving and 33 miles per gallon on the highway.  \n\nAdding all-wheel drive option drops those numbers to 26 miles per gallon in the city and 31 on the highway.  \n\nOpting for the higher performing 153 horsepower engine with front-wheel drive will get you an EPA estimated 25 miles per gallon in the city and 33 miles per gallon on the highway. All-wheel drive brings those estimates down to 24 and 30 respectively.  \n\nFor comparison, the [Toyota C-HR](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-c+hr), which is not offered with all-wheel drive, achieves an EPA estimated 27 miles per gallon in the city and 31 miles per gallon on the highway from its 144 horsepower engine.  \n\nThe [Honda HR-V](https://www.autolist.com/honda-hr+v) achieves an EPA estimated 28 miles per gallon in the city and 34 miles per gallon on the highway in front-wheel drive models but only produces 142 horsepower.  \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Pricing \u0026 Value  \n\nThe Buick Encore only provides average value for a subcompact SUV.  \n\nIt offers many standard features that would typically be upgrade options for other competitors. It also provides much of the traditional Buick comfort, reliability, and road composure that many long-time buyers have come to expect.  \n\nConversely, the Encore is priced higher than many competitors that are considered to be just as good in terms of quality and which have more safety and technology features.  \n\nWhile some safety features are available, many competitors offer more standard safety features at a comparable price.  \n\nAdditionally, the Encore is not particularly capable or comfortable on anything but the pavement, and it doesn’t offer class-leading cargo space.  \n\nAll Encore trims come standard with the base 1.4-liter turbocharged Ecotec engine producing 138 horsepower. The upgraded engine, producing 153 horsepower, is available on the Sport Touring and Essence trims.  \n\nAll engines are mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission, and all but the base model can be had with all-wheel-drive.  \n\nThe Buick Encore is available in four different trim options:  \n\n__Buick Encore 1SV:__ \n\nThe base Buick Encore model, equipped with the base 1.4-liter 138 horsepower engine, has an MSRP of $23,200. A $995 destination fee brings this total to just over $24,000.  \n\nIt comes standard with cruise control, air conditioning, a power driver’s seat, heated mirrors, rear privacy glass, keyless entry and push-button start, and 18-inch alloy wheels.  \n\nStandard technology includes an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, a rear camera, OnStar, satellite radio connected to a 6-speaker sound system, and a WiFi hotspot.  \n\n__Buick Encore Preferred: __ \n\nThe Preferred trim, equipped with the 1.4-liter 138 horsepower Ecotec engine and front-wheel drive, starts at just over $25,500 with destination fee included.  \n\nOpting for all-wheel-drive will bring with it a price increase of $1,500.  \n\nThe Preferred trim includes a cargo cover and several package options that aren’t available on the base 1SV trim.  \n\nBuyers can choose to add a moonroof, the Safety Package – which includes rear cross-traffic alert and blind spot monitoring, the Active Package – which consists of a rear cargo mat and trailer hitch, or the road trip package – which adds various accessories compatible with the roof rail system.  \n\n__Buick Encore Sport Touring:__\n\nThe Sport Touring trim, equipped with the 1.4-liter 138 horsepower turbocharged engine and front wheel drive, starts at $26,800 with destination included.  \n\nThe higher performing 153 horsepower engine is available at the cost of $900, while all-wheel drive is an additional $1500 option. Equipped with both, the Sport Touring trim starts around $29,000.  \n\nFog lights, a rear spoiler, and remote start are included as standard options with all packages available from the Preferred trim also available on the Sport Touring. Additionally, the 7-speaker Bose audio system is available on this and higher trim levels.  \n\n__Buick Encore Essence:__\n\nThe top-of-the-line Buick Encore Essence starts at around $30,200, with destination included, when equipped with the base 1.4-liter engine and front-wheel drive. Adding both the upgraded engine and all-wheel drive will bring that price up to $32,600.  \n\nThe Essence comes standard with a heated front driver and front passenger seat, a heated steering wheel, LED headlights, leather upholstery, power passenger seating, dual-zone automatic climate controls, and all the safety equipment included in the safety package, which is optional on lower trim levels.  \n\nAdditional safety options include lane departure warning, front and rear parking sensors, and forward collision alert. Other optional features include a sunroof, the seven-speaker Bose audio system, and automatic rain-sensing windshield wipers.

Sandwiched between the larger [XC90](https://www.autolist.com/volvo-xc90) and the smaller [XC40](https://www.autolist.com/volvo-xc40), the XC60 packs two rows and five passenger seats into a compact SUV body designed for modern comfort and competitive performance. The Volvo XC60's extensive selection of standard features, a wide variety of powertrain options, an aesthetically-appealing design makes it an alluring option when compared to other luxury crossover SUVs such as the [BMW X3](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-x3), Mercedes-Benz GLC, [Acura RDX](https://www.autolist.com/acura-rdx), and [Audi Q5](https://www.autolist.com/audi-q5). The Volvo XC60 comes in four trims — the Momentum, R-Design, Inscription, and Polestar Engineered — each with its own list of features and aesthetic add-ons.\n\nThe Volvo XC60's range of powertrain options includes turbocharged and supercharged engines, as well as a plug-in hybrid option (the T8) capable or traveling 17 miles on pure electricity. Aimed at safety-conscious small families and individual drivers in search of rear seats and just right amount of space, the XC60 stays true to Volvo's acclaimed safety ratings by offering a selection of best-in-class accident avoidance features such as lane-keeping pilot assist, automatic emergency braking, run-off-road mitigation, blind-spot monitoring, and pedestrian detection.\n\nNew on the 2019 Volvo XC60 is a front-wheel-drive model priced lower than its all-wheel-drive counterparts. There are several new standard package changes for the 2019 XC60, such as a faster processor for the Sensus infotainment console, as well as new options like an improved Harman Kardon premium audio system. Like all of today's Volvos, the XC60 features a useful engine idle-and-start system can be deactivated and kept off as a default setting. All XC60 models use an 8-speed automatic transmission. The Volvo XC60 is an excellent choice for those who prioritize modern comfort that doesn't cut corners on smooth SUV handling.  \n\n### Exterior \n\nAs far as overall dimensions go, the Volvo XC60 is on the smaller side for luxury midsized SUVs. However, it has generous cargo space (see detailed measurements in our Utility and Practicality section below). With all seats up, the XC60 seats five comfortably. \n\n![2019-volvo-cx60-exterior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2x4Qs6XYC9LGFf9tASqlwD/a44093a10143b2342bb06cacb7faf850/2019-volvo-cx60-exterior1.jpg)\n\nAppearance-wise, the XC60 resembles the larger [XC90](https://www.autolist.com/volvo-xc90) with sturdy tough-yet-elegant lines and a unique silhouette. The exterior appearance differs between trims, with the R-Design showcasing a slightly more aggressive look that features a glossed black grille as its centerpiece, with hammerhead-shaped headlights flanking it on either side.  All Volvo XC60 models are 15.4 feet long, with curb weights ranging from 3,888 to 4,716 pounds. Wheel options include the standard-issue 18-inch 5 Y-spoke silver wheels found on the Momentum, the 19-inch five double-spoke matt black diamond-cut alloy wheels on the R-Design, the 19-inch 10-spoke black diamond -cut alloy wheels on the Inscription, and the 21-inch 5 Y-spoke black polished forged alloy wheels on the Polestar Engineered.\n\n![2019-volvo-cx60-exterior3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4fK4fumz7LlpPAqXK0HPxI/259f4e22bbc8b9de7997d8beb73f508e/2019-volvo-cx60-exterior3.jpg)\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort\n\nEmbodying luxury at every edge, the interior of the Volvo XC60 comes with a myriad of standard and optional features designed to improve the experience for driver and passengers alike. Riders describe the XC60's as similar to that of the [XC90](https://www.autolist.com/volvo-xc90)'s, both of which hold to the distinctly \"Scandinavian feel\" found in many Volvos. Contributing to this aesthetic is an unmissable ribbon of woodgrain that courses through the middle of the dash. \n\n![2019-volvo-cx60-interior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/61B4EXkTY7K3wdKIsGNo16/2e50884bea728a92948835fd27019768/2019-volvo-cx60-interior1.jpg)\n\nAbove the steering wheel are clearly-readable meters with a driver-information flanked by a speedometer and tachometer. At the center of the dash is a sizeable Sensus infotainment system featuring an upgraded processor and a 9-inch touchscreen display. Much like the display screens Tesla vehicles — and unlike the display screens in other luxury midsize crossover SUVs — the display screen in the XC60 is oriented vertically. Buttons are intuitive and well-made, and Bluetooth connectivity is seamless. A fully digital, 12.3-inch TFT instrument panel is an option on Momentum models, while standard on all others.\n\nSeating in the XC60 is designed with comfort in mind. The driver's seat and front passenger seat feature superior adjustment and support, with 10-way power adjustments and dual climate control upfront. The rear-seat area can comfortably fit three adults and still have enough room for a sizeable amount of cargo in the back. The majority of XC60 models feature genuine leather as an option, (and it is by far the most popular option for drivers), though it is not standard. New to the 2019 XC60 is the Leatherette material available in base Momentum trims.\n\n![2019-volvo-cx60-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1rorAhgmUIXIWGZjV2Q1GV/63323dc57d67c2fe6e17d84b5deef668/2019-volvo-cx60-interior2.jpg)\n\nStandard on all XC60 models is a panoramic moonroof, which contributes significantly to the luxury atmosphere of the interior. Optional interior features include onboard navigation and an upgraded new Harman Kardon premium audio system. Top-of-the-line Inscription and Polestar Engineered trims also feature driftwood inlays and quad-zone climate control.\n\n### Utility and Practicality\n\nIn line with its wide range of comfort-centric features, the Volvo XC60 also offers a host of tools and design innovations designed to optimize the user experience. Given its overall size, the XC60 has generous cargo space at 22.4 cubic feet with the back row of seats up and 63.3 cubic feet of space with them down. (The latter is one of the best cargo area metrics in the crossover SUV class.) Optional roof racks may be added for additional cargo-carrying capabilities. \n\n![2019-volvo-cx60-exterior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/pDMGIMV6NzaBifvtlnzAA/4a2521c09e2071c6cfc72ecd9f99c406/2019-volvo-cx60-exterior2.jpg)\n\nAll three available engines on the XC60 can tow up to 3,500 pounds, great for small trailers or recreational vehicles. To make loading and unloading easy, the XC60 features a powered, hands-free tailgate. Other user-friendly features include an available foldable tow bar, active chassis with air suspension, and Trailer Stability Assist.\n\n### Technology and Infotainment\n\nThe 2019 Volvo XC60 features a myriad of modern technology and infotainment features designed to optimize both comfort and overall performance. Users report excellent build quality in the dash and consoles, as well as satisfactory interior finishes and seating fabrics, the latter of which includes the perforated Nappa Leather upholstery on top Inscription models. Though the vertical infotainment screen is a bit of a departure from traditional infotainment systems, most users report the center infotainment system to be quite intuitive. The dash layout is minimalist and mostly operated through the centrally mounted touchscreen, which may be unusual for drivers used to many buttons and knobs.\n\n![2019-volvo-cx60-interior3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2n5JD6awcqGArShXlueOLV/5acfd7495b84d876282ec1c2bbf02cf0/2019-volvo-cx60-interior3.jpg)\n\nThe infotainment system on the Volvo XC60 is powered by a new and improved Sensus Connect processor. All XC60 models feature either partially- or fully-digital instrument clusters that users review as well-built and responsive. All models feature a standard 10-speaker stereo featuring Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Voice control is also standard on Volvo XC60 models. Other standard interior features include Bluetooth, satellite radio, and an in-cabin air filtration system. Optional tech features on the Volvo XC60 include a 14-speaker premium Harman Kardon sound system, 19-speaker Bowers \u0026 Wilkins audio system, four-zone automatic climate control and built-in navigation system. Each Volvo XC60 model features two USB ports.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Safety and Driving Assistance\n\nUpholding Volvo's storied history of safety innovation, the Volvo XC60 features an extensive list of high-performing safety features. Standard safety features on all XC60 models include run-off-road mitigation and protection, oncoming lane mitigation, collision mitigation with active braking, automatic braking after a collision, a driver drowsiness monitor, active high-beam headlights, lane keep assist, traffic sign recognition, and a rearview camera. The Volvo XC60 also includes a state-of-the-art system that continuously scans for intersections, pedestrians, cyclists, and even large animals. This system is standard on all models.\n\nIn addition to the standard safety features on the Volvo XC60, all models have a host of optional safety features to improve peace of mind for drivers further. Most notable among the optional safety features available on the XC60 is Pilot Assist, Volvo's semi-autonomous system that provides helpful driving support to help a driver keep the XC60 centered in its lane and safely spaced behind the vehicle in front of it. Additional optional safety features include blind spot monitoring plus steering assist, rear cross traffic alert, rear collision warning with braking, front and rear parking sensors, active park assist, distance alert adaptive cruise control, onboard heads-up display, and a 360-degree camera.\n\nAs is customary with Volvo vehicles, the 2019 Volvo XC60 earned the honor of 2019 Top Safety Pick from the Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), earning \"Good\" scores on all safety metrics aside from Headlights and Child Seat Anchors (Latch) Ease of Use, both of which earned \"Acceptable\" scores. The XC60 also received a rarely-given \"Superior\" score for its Front Crash Prevention performance. According to data from NHTSA, there have been two safety recalls for the 2019 Volvo XC60: one for a small software feature in the Vehicle Connectivity Module (VCM) and one for the hybrid XC60s featuring AeroVironment electric vehicle TurboCord and TurboDock/TurboDX charging systems.\n\n### Driving Experience\n\nThree engine options are available for the 2019 Volvo XC60. The first is the T5, a 2.0-liter, 4-cylinder direct-injection turbocharged engine, which features 250 horsepower at 5,500 rpm and 258 lb-ft of torque at 1,500 - 4,800 rpm. The second is the T6, a 2.0 liter 4-cylinder direct-injection turbocharged and supercharged engine rated to deliver 316 horsepower at 5,700 rpm and 295 lb-ft of torque at 2,200 - 5,400 rpm. The final and most complex engine is the high-performing T8, which combines a 2.0-liter, 4-cylinder direct-injection turbocharged and supercharged engine with a lithium-ion-battery-powered electric motor. The T8 delivers 400 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 472 lb-ft of torque at 2,200 - 5,400 rpm.\n\nFront-wheel drive (FWD) is now available on all T5 models, giving drivers a cost-effective option in the 2019 XC60 line. Models with T6 and T8 engines have all-wheel drive (AWD) standard. All Volvo XC60 models use a refined and smooth 8-speed automatic transmission.\n\nOut on the road, the Volvo packs a punch only achievable with turbocharged (and, in the case of the T6 and T8, supercharged) engine. Users describe the T5 engine as \"zippy,\" the T6 as an accelerating phenom, and the T8 as incredibly powerful given its environmental friendliness. With multiple drive modes, including a special individualized mode, the new Volvo XC60 can quickly be set to handle sporty settings, comfort-oriented cruising, fuel-efficient driving, and even off-roading. The latter is optimized by an available Four-C Active Chassis or a Sport Chassis.\n\nDrivers report that visibility in all Volvo XC60 models is adequate. All Volvo XC60 models feature an Antilock Braking System (ABS) with Electronic Brake Distribution (EBD) and Electronic Brake Assistance (EBA).\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Fuel Efficiency\n\nAcross all engines and models, the Volvo XC60 has impressive fuel efficiency. The peak miles-per-gallon rate is achieved with the T8 engine, which boasts an excellent EPA-estimated 26 mpg in the city, 28 mpg on the highway, and 26 mpg during combined driving. Both the T5 and T6 engine are rated at 22 mpg in the city, 28 mpg on the highway, and 24 mpg during combined driving. The T8 is among the most fuel-efficient compact crossover SUVs on the market today, boasting better fuel economy than both the Mercedes-Benz GLC and the [Acura RDX](https://www.autolist.com/acura-rdx).\n\n### Pricing and Value\n\nHistorically, the Volvo XC60 has been on the more expensive side when compact luxury crossover SUVs. However, this has changed in 2019 thanks to the front-wheel-drive T5 Momentum model. This new base model has a retail price of just over $40,000 (including destination), nearly $2,000 less than the 2018 base model for the Volvo XC60, which came with all wheel. As expected, moving up to higher trim levels such as the R-Design, Inscription, and Polestar Engineered with increase the price by thousands at minimum. For example, a fully-featured XC60 T8 Inscription is priced at just over $60,000. However, as the T8 is a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) that qualifies for $5,000 federal tax credit, owners may be able to take advantage of local and federal EV incentives.\n\nGenerally speaking, Volvo's XC60 prices sit squarely in the middle of Japanese luxury SUVs such as the [Acura RDX](https://www.autolist.com/acura-rdx), [Infiniti QX50](https://www.autolist.com/infiniti-qx50), Lexus NX and those of more-expensive European automobiles such as the [Audi Q5](https://www.autolist.com/audi-q5), Mercedes-Benz GLC, and [BMW X3](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-x3). Given the track record of reliability that comes with the Volvo name, the Volvo XC60's resale value is expected to hold up well in coming years, notably outstripped only by that of the [Audi Q5](https://www.autolist.com/audi-q5).","locale":"en","indexed":true,"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/volvo-xc60#year_min=2019\u0026year_max=2019","modified_date":"2019-05-17T17:34:22.439Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5MfumTlUlN8B3XZDII0SSb/b4a07ce5cf65f7f15f47c3f28d68e650/2019-nissan-sentra-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/mJrpyQ7PNHP9yEn2qY9M4/72b290638853a606751b181c1290fc1d/2019-nissan-sentra-325-image_.jpg","slug":"2019-nissan-sentra-review","title":"2019 Nissan Sentra Review","publication_date":"2019-05-07T10:50-08:00","content_summary":"The Nissan Sentra represents a good value, especially in lower trim levels, and offers some of the best cargo and passenger space in its segment.

The Sentra is aimed at budget-conscious young new car buyers and small families seeking a no-frills sedan. Until 2007, the Sentra was considered a sub-compact car but was reclassified by the EPA because of its spacious interior. The Nissan Versa was added to the lineup as an entry-level car.\n\nThe 2019 Sentra is sold in four trims: S, SV, SR, and SL. Two other performance-oriented Sentra models are sold as separate vehicles: The Sentra NISMO and Sentra SR Turbo.  The SR Turbo is based on the standard Sentra SR and features an upgraded 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine with 188 horsepower and 166 pound-feet of torque. The car has a standard manual transmission but is available with a specially-tuned version of the continuously variable transmission found in other Sentra models. Steering and brakes are upgraded, and the Sentra SR Turbo uses larger 17-inch wheels with stiffer suspension components.\n\nThe Sentra NISMO is designed to be more aggressively styled than the SR and SR Turbo models and has unique aerodynamic bodywork, NISMO badges, dark chrome door handles, 18-inch wheels, and a NISMO exhaust. Inside, the Sentra NISMO has red accents and many of the upgraded technology features that are found on the Sentra SL.\n\nThe Sentra has been around for nearly 40 years and is in its seventh generation. Known as the B17 Sentra, the current version has been on sale without a significant overhaul since 2013.  The car was given a facelift for the 2016 model year.  eviewers note that, while the Sentra has been updated with current safety features and technologies, interior components and the overall design are behind more recently-updated rivals like the [Toyota Corolla](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-corolla) and [Honda Civic](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic).\n\nThe Sentra is due for a complete overhaul soon, but changes for the 2019 model year are less significant. Updates include NissanConnect, which is now standard for all trims except for the base model. The technology package brings Apple CarPlay and Android Auto to the Sentra for the first time. There is also a new SV Special Edition package that includes upgraded 17-inch wheels, rear disc brakes, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alerts, intelligent cruise control, a power sliding glass moonroof, and special edition badges.\n\n### Exterior\n\nThe Sentra’s exterior loosely mirrors the designs of its larger cousin, the Nissan Altima.  Reviewers make a note of the Sentra’s athletic curves and fender flares. The sharp “V”-shaped grille is flanked by angular LED running lights, and the lower bumper can be upgraded with fog lights in higher trim levels. Many critics like the Sentra’s clean and athletic lines but take away points for an overall design that doesn’t take many risks in the styling department.\n\n![2019-nissan-sentra-exterior3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2v8SdG8VHk3u20tHN1hY2T/55c1200aa157e3b6e6edf73f07eb757a/2019-nissan-sentra-exterior3.jpg)\n\nHigher trims like the SR get larger 17-inch 10-spoke wheels, lower body side sills, a rear spoiler, fog lights, and chrome exhaust tips.  he Sentra NISMO has additional front spoilers and aerodynamic work and a NISMO spoiler on the rear deck lid. This model also comes with 18-inch wheels – the largest available on any Sentra.\n\n![2019-nissan-sentra-exterior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4G5eMhqDIo3bml9CGZWQ9M/4edd670cef635d20df5b83e6492825a4/2019-nissan-sentra-exterior1.jpg)\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort\n\nThe Sentra has one of the largest interiors in its class – large enough in the latest versions to cause the vehicle to be upgraded from a sub-compact car to a compact car by the EPA. With 111 cubic feet of interior space, critics like the Sentra’s rear seat legroom and generous front and rear seat headroom. Even so, the high seating position in the front row can cause issues for taller drivers.\n\n![2019-nissan-sentra-interior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7fJIPNhkTJhur8JsTAb1e6/4fe8e80bd2fc93197db765b0a9b5f245/2019-nissan-sentra-interior1.jpg)\n\nThe rear seats are also placed high in the cabin which helps with entry and exit.  Reviewers praised the Sentra for its sizeable back door openings and high roof, which makes seating for adults much more reasonable.\n\n![2019-nissan-sentra-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/OV2l8NLI69gQOrJXzjNPp/a79ba00120d8fc972c90e8bca98173e8/2019-nissan-sentra-interior2.jpg)\n\nMany critics note that the Sentra’s interior is of good quality when compared to other vehicles in its segment, but rivals like the VW Golf and Honda Civic are more polished overall. Parts of the cabin that are frequently touched by passengers are quality and well-padded, and the interior materials don’t feel cheap or hastily put together. A common complaint among critics is the Sentra’s dated interior feel. Since its last major update in 2013, the Sentra’s interior has not seen significant changes to its components. While robust and well-constructed, the Sentra is outdone by competitors in the segment.\n\nAll Sentra models come standard with a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment unit.  Bluetooth audio/phone connectivity, voice recognition, USB inputs, and a four-speaker audio system are standard. Sentra SV and SR trims come with six speakers and add Apple CarPlay/Android Auto and SiriusXM Radio. The SL trim has a Bose eight-speaker sound system.\n\n![2019-nissan-sentra-interior3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4b9rbWms93A24UrBkzBaZH/2ae11aaa69bed622998c04f0d8d28c3b/2019-nissan-sentra-interior3.jpg)\n\n### Utility and Practicality\n\nThe Sentra is considered to be a practical car, especially for its size.  Interior space adds up to 111 cubic feet, which is among the best in the Sentra’s class.  A long wheelbase of 106.3 inches contributes to the spacious interior and also allows for 37.4 inches of rear seat leg room.  It has 15 cubic feet of trunk space which stacks up well in the segment, and the 60/40 folding rear seats open up the cargo space for larger and longer items. Compared against other cars in its segment, the Sentra is slightly larger than the [Toyota Corolla](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-corolla), [Hyundai Elantra](https://www.autolist.com/hyundai-elantra), and the [Honda Civic](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic) Sedan. Reviewers note that the difference is not as noticeable in the real-world operation of the vehicles, but the Sentra is technically larger on the inside than the other three cars.\n\n![2019-nissan-sentra-exterior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7qDzjcUSihO1DvvwVoRAkK/a3ddd120ae7066b5263fae8314646769/2019-nissan-sentra-exterior2.jpg)\n\nEven with its large trunk and folding seats, critics note that interior storage space in the Sentra is only adequate. Cup holders are small, especially for travel mugs and large take out cups, and the center console storage area is not sufficient for larger items.  Door pockets and seat back pockets offer supplemental storage but are also too small to hold items much larger than a sunglasses case. \n\n### Safety and Driving Assistance\n\nThe Nissan Sentra has earned good scores from safety testing agencies like the IIHS and NHTSA.  In IIHS testing, the 2019 Sentra was rated “Good” for driver side and passenger side crashworthiness and also earned a “Good” rating for roof strength and head restraints/seats.  Front crash prevention is rated as “Superior” with optional equipment installed.  The IIHS also rated the Sentra’s headlights as “Acceptable” – its lowest score in testing. The Sentra earned a Top Safety Pick rating from the agency.\n\nThe NHTSA has not yet rated the 2019 Sentra but awarded the very similar 2018 model four out of five stars overall.\n\nAll Sentra models come with a Nissan Advanced Air Bag System, front seat-mounted side-impact supplemental air bags, a power window lockout button, and child safety rear door locks.  Blind spot warnings and rear cross-traffic alerts are optional for all but the base trim level.  There is no automatic emergency braking or adaptive cruise control.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Driving Experience\n\nThe Nissan Sentra is not designed to be a fast car, but reviewers note a smooth and confident ride with good braking and steering performance.  The Sentra comes standard with a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine that has 124 horsepower. Among the slowest cars in its class, the Sentra equipped with this engine has a 0-60 mph time of 10 seconds. Critics note that this engine is noisy under heavy acceleration.  The Sentra earns points with reviewers for its well-matched powertrain. The 1.8-liter engine and XTronic CVT transmission work well together, even with the lack of acceleration and power.\n\nSentra models with the upgraded 1.6-liter engine have 188 horsepower and stiffer suspension components. Reviewers note that the difference between the Sentra’s two engines is not dramatic, but that cars with the more powerful engine are noticeably quicker.  The standard Sentra models are noted as being smooth and comfortable on longer trips, with the ability to soak up all but the worst of road imperfections. The Sentra SR Turbo and Sentra NISMO are noted as having a comfortable but busier ride, thanks to their stiffer suspensions and sharper steering.\n\nThe Sentra’s tall profile contributes to body roll during hard cornering and sharp turns, but critics note its steering as being accurate.  Reviewers liked the even steering weight at most speeds, which is how easily the steering wheel can be turned.  Many vehicles have heavier (harder) steering at low speeds and lighter (easier) driving at high speeds, but the Sentra maintains predictable steering feel across the board.\n\n### Fuel Efficiency\n\nThe Sentra is considered to be a very fuel-efficient vehicle, but it isn’t the best in its class. With the base 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine and manual transmission, the [Altima](https://www.autolist.com/nissan-altima) has EPA-estimated fuel economy ratings of 27/35/30 city/highway/combined mpg. The automatic transmission changes those numbers to 29/37/32 mpg.\n\nWith the 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine and manual transmission, the Sentra is rated at 25/31/27 mpg city/highway/combined.  With an automatic transmission, those numbers change to 25/30/27 mpg.\n\nThese fuel economy numbers are average for the segment. Critics note that the Sentra easily exceeds its advertised fuel consumption ratings, but that many competitors do better.  Some of the difference is due in part to the Sentra’s size, but the Chevrolet Cruze is rated at 28 mpg city and 48 mpg highway and is of similar proportions.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Pricing \u0026 Value\n\nThe Sentra is considered to be a good value for a compact sedan, especially in its lower trim levels.  The Sentra S is competitive against vehicles like the [Toyota Corolla](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-corolla) and [Honda Civic](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic), but the other cars include more standard features for a slightly higher price.  The Sentra undercuts rivals like the [Honda Civic](https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic) and [Toyota Corolla](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-corolla) by nearly $1,000, but the other two cars have been more recently overhauled and include more modern interiors.\n\nReviewers note that Sentra models with the upgraded 1.6-liter engine are more fun to drive and are more desirable overall because of their standard features, but that the pricing is too high when compared against the Sentra’s rivals.\n\nThe Sentra comes with a five-year, 60,000-mile powertrain warranty and a three-year, 36,000-mile roadside assistance plan that includes flat-tire changes, trip interruption benefits, jump starts, lock assistance and emergency fuel delivery.  Competitors like the [Toyota Corolla](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-corolla) come with no-cost maintenance plans that cover oil changes and other routine services for the first two years of ownership.\n\n__S Trim__\n\nThe S trim has an MSRP that starts at $18,785 including an $895 destination charge, and has a 1.8-liter inline four-cylinder engine that has 124 horsepower and 125 pound-feet of torque, a six-speed manual transmission, automatic halogen headlights, cloth upholstery, air conditioning, manual seat adjustments, a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system, keyless entry, cruise control, power windows/door locks, and a rearview monitor.  Upgrading to an automatic transmission increases the total price to $19,475.\n\n__SV Trim__\n\nThe SV trim has an MSRP that starts at $20,085 including destination charge and adds a leather-wrapped steering wheel, alloy wheels, premium cloth upholstery, SiriusXM Radio, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, keyless push-button start, dual-zone automatic climate controls, and piano black interior trim.\n\n__SR Trim__\n\nThe SR trim has an MSRP that starts at $21,585 including destination, and adds 17-inch wheels, projector LED headlights, heated outside mirrors, premium sport cloth seats, and intelligent cruise control.\n\n__SL Trim__\n\nThe SL trim has an MSRP that starts at $24,015 including destination and includes a power sliding moonroof, leather upholstery, power driver’s seat adjustment, heated front seats, a Bose sound system, blind spot warnings, and rear cross-traffic alerts.\n\n__SR Turbo__\n\nThe Sentra SR Turbo has an MSRP that starts at $23,565 including destination and has a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine with Direct Injection Gasoline (DIGÔ) that delivers 188 horsepower.\n\n__Sentra NISMO__\n\nThe Sentra NISMO has an MSRP that starts at $26,835 and includes distinctive NISMO exterior bodywork, upgraded 18-inch wheels, an Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel, and red interior accents.\n\nNissan offers a variety of packages that are available based on trim level.  The Appearance Package is available for the Sentra S and includes 16-inch alloy wheels and a rear spoiler.  \n\nThe All-Weather Package is available for the Sentra SV and includes heated front seats and heated outside mirrors.  \n\nThe Premium Package is available for the Sentra SR and include a power moonroof, LED interior lighting, a HomeLink Universal Transceiver, blind spot warnings, rear cross-traffic alerts, a Bose sound system, leather upholstery and power driver’s seat adjustments.\n\nThe Special Edition Package is available for SV models and includes 17-inch wheels, blind spot warnings, rear cross-traffic alerts, a power moonroof, and Special Edition badges.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Reviews","Sedan"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/nissan-sentra#year_min=2019\u0026year_max=2019","modified_date":"2019-05-17T17:34:22.607Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/nLY0FXWdlFhT7rmChXt3H/9d6c2471f565886997af2df6ee919e4a/2019-ford-f-250-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7khoTbGTK5WdQMbY7IHYLk/0a66f8ad4ab10f1b0611926c6be8c7c2/2019-ford-f-250-325-image.jpg","slug":"2019-ford-f-250-review","title":"2019 Ford F-250 Review","publication_date":"2019-05-06T09:31-08:00","content_summary":"The Ford F-250 Super Duty pickup is a full-size pickup truck which competes against the RAM 2500, Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD, and GMC Sierra 2500HD.","parent_page":{"name":"Ford F-250","slug":"ford-f+250"},"categories":[{"name":"Car Review","description":"Autolist Car Review","parentCategory":{"name":"Reviews","description":"Reviews"}}],"category":{"name":"Car Review","description":"Autolist Car Review","parentCategory":{"name":"Reviews","description":"Reviews"}},"author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"body":"### Summary\n\nThe Ford F-250 pickup is full-size, heavy-duty pickup truck that competes with the [Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-silverado+2500hd), [GMC Sierra 2500HD](https://www.autolist.com/gmc-sierra+2500hd), and the [Ram 2500](https://www.autolist.com/dodge-ram+pickup+2500). The F-250 Super Duty is currently in its third generation.  \n\nIt is larger and able to do a bit more than its little brother, the [Ford F-150](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+150). It is also smaller and more toned-down than its larger siblings within the Ford F-series Super Duty line, the [Ford F-350](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+350+super+duty) and [F-450](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+450+super+duty) models.  \n\nNew for 2019 is the Lariat Sport Package which is similar to sport packages on other vehicles. It includes black trim where chrome painted trim used to be, black running boards, and 20-inch black painted wheels for a more aggressive styling touch.  \n\nAlso new for 2019 is the option to add a Bang and Olufsen Play 10-speaker audio system.   \n\nThe Ford F-250 Super Duty pickup has always been known as a workhorse. It is nearly unrivaled in its ability to tow, haul, and get the job done, but thanks to modern technology and a heaping helping of class, the F-250 can quickly transform into an extreme luxury pickup truck.\n\nFully loaded, its price can touch $90,000, something unprecedented with this kind of vehicle’s history, capability, and pedigree.  \n\n### Exterior\n\nThe F-250 is large and serious in its appearance.  \n\nThose used to driving the [F-150](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+150) pickup will take note of the similarities to its larger sibling but will have to make an adjustment to its larger size if a step up is imminent.  \n\nThe F-250 is boxy in its appearance. The headlights look as though they are engulfing the grille as they curl around the corners of the prominent chrome colored centerpiece. The LED running lights enhance this look even more as they surround the outside of the headlights.  \n\n![2019-ford-f-250-exterior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5dVxMSKLar2hn6lERJAmCA/d2dc94d08c90823b4cd17fda60d7e359/2019-ford-f-250-exterior1.jpg)\n\nThere are no real character lines to speak of as the true purpose of the pickup is to accomplish work rather than slide through the air or sit in an art gallery.  \n\nBeyond the styling touches up front, the F-250 looks normal for a pickup.  \n\nOpting for the large 8.2-foot bed with the four door crew cab layout makes the truck look enormous while the regular cab and shorter 6.8-foot bed makes it appear tipsy with how high the truck sits off the ground.  \n\nAdding the Lariat Sport Appearance Package gives the F-250 a sleeker, lower, and faster look. Blacked out trim pieces, 20-inch black painted aluminum wheels, and black mirror caps add a fun look to its otherwise “business-as-usual” appearance.    \n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort\n\nInterior quality is as expected for this type of truck. Reviewers note that while the materials on the higher trim models are completely appropriate, plastic pieces are scattered throughout the cabin with the quality materials which make this truck so comfortable.  \n\n![2019-ford-f-250-interior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5gt9p4LnCU2DkK3pb6KYJA/1117d40f06fc1a181e306b93abcd98f2/2019-ford-f-250-interior1.jpg)\n\nComfort is noted to be high. “Plush” is the word that almost every reviewer used when describing the comfort of the cabin, seats, and ride quality. Reviewers say that noise is muted and is less than expected, even with the diesel engine option.  \n\nThe cabin has no trouble accommodating both children and adults. One reviewer says that a passenger can adjust the front seat to any position he would want, and there would still be plenty of room in the rear seat for another occupant.  \n\nLower trim models aren’t as luxuriously appointed with manual roll up windows, vinyl upholstery, and an overall bare bones interior. This is as expected for a true work truck, but also won’t make anybody feel too bad about damaging it or getting it dirty.  \n\n### Utility \u0026 Practicality\n\nBoth utility and practicality are top priorities for the F-250.  \n\nThe choice of a 6.8-foot bed or 8.2-foot bed can be had with a maximum hauling capacity of 4200 pounds. Towing capacity is equally impressive with a maximum towing weight of 15,000 pounds, both of which are best in class.  \n\n![2019-ford-f-250-exterior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1Mcim1MnjibSu7UeVHgdWY/dc053c0fbab10070a3d8fc9d259746b2/2019-ford-f-250-exterior2.jpg)\n\nFor additional towing capability, the Ultimate Trailer Tow Camera System package can be equipped when fitted with the Powerstroke turbodiesel engine. It adds an entire camera system with an additional rear camera that can be fitted to the trailer being towed.  \n\nThe FX4 off-road package is even available to give the F-250 some additional off-road capability. This package includes a locking rear differential and the ability to shift into four-wheel drive while moving.  \n\nCab options are flexible with a regular, extended, or crew cab available. The four door crew cab can accommodate up to six passengers. The rear seats in the crew cab fold up for an even more storage space.  \n\nA LATCH child safety seat system is equipped on all three rear seats in crew cab models for added practicality.  \n\nWith the large amount of cabin space comes a large amount of interior storage. The center console is notably cavernous with plenty of additional cup holders, map pockets, and door storage throughout the cabin.  \n\n### Technology \u0026 Infotainment\n\nA large number of technology and infotainment offerings are part of what makes the F-250 such a usable vehicle.  \n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto are available along with Ford’s voice controlled Sync 3 infotainment system, also controllable via an 8-inch touchscreen display.  \n\n![2019-ford-f-250-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4z03LDnuyzRXS8Abu8fKjq/ba65db6ad8aadf7abd420792c419f533/2019-ford-f-250-interior2.jpg)\n\nThe voice controls are heavily praised by reviewers. They find the system to be responsive without having to emphasize or repeat phrases.  \n\nA Navigation system, Bluetooth, and a host of other customizable features are available through the reportedly responsive and easy to use system.  \n\nAn adjustable blind-spot monitoring system, a 360 degree view camera, a Bang and Olufsen Play 10-speaker audio system, and a digital driver information display round out the most notable technology features that Ford offers.  \n\n### Safety \u0026 Driving Assistance\n\nThe 2019 Ford F-250 hasn’t been crash tested, but in 2017, when the current generation F-250 went on sale, the NHTSA gave the F-250 crew cab a five star safety rating.  \n\nSafety features include a Rollover Stability Control system, Ford’s Safety Canopy System which features side curtain airbags, and a rearview camera with hitch assist.  \n\nAdditionally, the F-250 offers the MyKey system. This allows one or more of the vehicle’s keys to be programmed to limit certain driving parameters. Speed and radio volume can be limited and seatbelt status can be monitored in a programmed key.  \n\nDriving assistance options include adjustable blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, rear cross-traffic alert, and a 360 degree view camera.  \n\nAutomatic emergency braking and forward collision warning are not available.  \n\n### Driving Experience\n\nReviewers of the F-250 Super Duty are impressed but not surprised by the amount of power, luxury, and capability it possesses.  \n\nThere are only two engine options available across the Ford Super Duty lineup.  \n\nThe naturally aspirated, 6.2 liter V8 engine produces 385 horsepower and 430 lb-ft. of torque. \n\nThe 6.7 liter Powerstroke turbodiesel V8 produces 450 horsepower and 935 lb-ft. of torque, making this the preferred engine for towing.  \n\nAll engine options are paired to a 6-speed automatic transmission with Torqshift.  \n\nWhile they don’t find any faults with the F-250’s handling, reviewers state that corners force the truck show off its 7000 pound weight. They note the slightly numb steering feel, but praise its ease at low speeds.  \n\nThough handling through corners is said to be slightly unsettling, testers are pleased by the high maneuverability of the F-250, especially in a tight setting. They attest this to the truck’s adaptive steering system which increases in resistance the more the wheel is turned.  \n\nThe F-250’s weight is not a hindrance to its acceleration or highway passing due to the massive amount of torque produced by the turbodiesel engine, according to reviewers.  \n\nThe gasoline powered V8 engine did not impress testers as much, but was sufficient to move the truck when necessary.  \n\nTesters say that the transmission is smooth and free of jerking even in tow-haul mode, but that the absence of a payload helps smooth everything out.  \n\nBraking is the least confident element of the driving experience according to testers. The brakes are noted to feel inconsistent but aren’t lacking bite when the pedal is pushed firmly.  \n### Fuel efficiency\n\nAccording to the EPA, all cars and light-duty trucks sold in the United States are mandated to be tested for fuel economy. The EPA does not require the same of heavy duty pickup trucks; therefore, the EPA estimated gas mileage is not available for the 2019 F-250.  \n\nA 48-gallon fuel tank is available on the F-250 for extended range.  \n\n### Pricing \u0026 Value\n\nThe Ford F-250 Super Duty is comparable to its competitors in terms of both price and value except for the very highest trim levels which generally exceed competitors’ pricing.  \n\nFor a work truck, the lowest XL trim is a good value. The Super Duty is designed to be tough, durable, and materials are such that they will not be easily damaged.  \n\nThe XLT and Lariat models provide a good amount of comfort features with many options available for towing, off-roading, and safety. Ideal for a family without going overboard on any amount of luxury, these trim levels provide the most all-around bang for your buck.  \n\nThe King Ranch, Platinum, and Limited trims have many luxury, safety, and technology features, but aren’t up to par with some of the lower-priced SUVs and luxury cars on the market. If hauling and towing are necessities, they will fit the bill but also cost more than RAM and Chevrolet competitors.  \n\nF-250 pickups are available with two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. All are available with the choice of a regular 6.8-foot bed or a larger 8.2-foot bed.  \n\nRegular, extended and crew cab configurations are available, while the King Ranch, Platinum, and Limited trims are only available in crew cab configurations.  \n\nBoth the 6.2 liter V8 gasoline engine and 6.7 turbodiesel engines are available on all trim levels.  \n\nThe Ford F-250 pickup truck is available in six different trim options:  \n\n__Ford F-250 XL __\n\nThe base XL trim starts at $36,500 MSRP with the regular cab configuration, 6.2 liter gasoline engine, extended bed, and four-wheel drive equipped, including destination.  \n\n17-inch steel wheels, vinyl upholstery, manually operated windows, a 2-inch tow hitch, air conditioning, a 4-speaker audio system, and driver information display are all standard features. Four-wheel drive models require a manual front locking system to engage.  \n\nRear-wheel drive is standard and reduces the price of the truck by about $1000. Opting for the crew cab configuration will cost an additional $4000.  \n\n__Ford F-250 XLT__\n\nThe F-250 XLT starts at $41,750 with the regular cab configuration, 6.2 liter V8 gasoline engine, extended bed, and four-wheel drive equipped, including destination. Rear-wheel drive is standard and reduces about $1000 from the price.  \n\nPower locks, power windows, and mirrors are added to the list of features along with cruise control, satellite radio capability, voice controls, keyless entry, upgraded 18-inch alloy wheels, and locking hooks in the bed.  \n\nOpting for the crew cab configuration will cost an additional $4000.  \n\n__Ford F-250 Lariat__\n\nThe Lariat trim starts at $51,000 with the 6.2 liter V8 gasoline engine, extended bed, and four-wheel drive equipped, including destination. It is only available in the super cab or crew cab configuration.   \n\nFeatures for the Lariat include leather seating, dual zone climate controls, power rear window, power-adjustable front seating, running boards, Sync 3 infotainment system with a larger 8-inch touchscreen display, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, WiFi hotspot capability, upgraded Bang and Olufsen 10-speaker audio system, and three 110 volt power outlets.  \n\nRear-wheel drive is standard with four-wheel drive being optional. A shift-on-the-go system is comes standard with four-wheel drive equipped Lariat models, allowing the driver to change four two to four-wheel drive while moving.  \n\n__Ford F-250 King Ranch__\n\nThe King Ranch starts at just over $60,000 with the crew cab configuration, 6.2 liter V8 gasoline engine, extended bed, and four-wheel drive equipped.  \n\nRemote start, a heated steering wheel, and heated and ventilated front seats are standard on the King Ranch along with an LED-illuminated truck bed.  \n\n__Ford F-250 Platinum __\n\nThe F-250 Platinum starts at $65,000 with the crew cab configuration, 6.2 liter V8 gasoline engine, extended cab, and four-wheel drive, including destination.  \n\nTechnology features include LED headlights, automatic retractable power running boards, and remote tailgate release with an integrated tailgate step. 20-inch alloy wheels are upgraded from the 18-inch alloys on lower trims.  \n\nSafety features include blind spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert.  \n\n__Ford F-250 Limited__\n\nThe F-250 limited is the highest trim level offered by Ford. It starts at almost $82,000 and is only available with the 6.7 liter turbocharged diesel engine. The crew cab, extended bed, and destination is included in this price.  \n\nThe Limited trim adds a panoramic sunroof and special interior trim color. It also includes additional safety features such as adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, and a 360 degree view camera.

The 2019 Dodge Challenger is designed from the same mold as the popular [Dodge Charger](https://www.autolist.com/dodge-charger) model, but It’s a bit bigger than the rivals in the its class, including the [Chevy Camaro](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-camaro) and [Ford Mustang](https://www.autolist.com/ford-mustang), as it has a usable rear seat and a spacious trunk.\n\nThe 2019 of the Challenger has a new trim, which is the 797-horsepower Hellcat Redeye. The standard horsepower of the Hellcat has increased to 717, and several trims and options upgrades have been added throughout the simplified lineup of Challenger options. All of the R/T Scat Pack models gained the aluminum hood, formerly on the Hellcat only, with the R/T version now offered in Widebody form.\n\nThe R/T model has also received performance suspension upgrades, revised steering, shift paddles for the automatic transmission models, and 20-inch wheels. There’s also a new performance handling group for the R/T that’s specifically designed to help improve overall handling response.\n\n### Exterior\n\nThe Challenger features a classic long-hood and short-deck proportions, with a wider stance. Featuring flared fenders, along with other details, the R/T and Hellcat models provide the classic muscle car feel. Other appealing details of the exterior include badging and optional stripes, which give the newest Challenger a retro feel.\n\nThe 2019 model offers a pair of LED, full-width, split taillamps in the rear with gloss black surrounds, making them noticeable for any of the available exterior colors. Optimal performance of the vehicle is maintained thanks to the optional Illuminated Air Catcher Headlamps. These work to keep the engine cool by absorbing the air while the car is moving.\n\n![2019-dodge-challenger-exterior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6JRyPeqcPCew5Kj9uw2DoY/26903c809df2e1732d51032d38bbb44d/2019-dodge-challenger-exterior2.jpg)\n\nThere are four basic hood options to choose from for the 2019 model, which include:\n\nSRT Dual Snorkel Hood. With the Mopar cold air intake, the Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat provides a classic muscle car shape and look.\n\nR/T and GT. Showcasing raw power, this hood comes standard on GT and R/T models, available on the T/A 392 and T/A with the Mopar cold air intake.\n\nR/T Scat Pack. The Scat Pack includes various performance-enhancing technologies, which include dual air extractors and a patented Air-Catcher, as well as an aesthetic hood scoop.\n\nShaker Models. Both the R/T Scat Pack Shaker and the R/T Shaker provide the functional, exposed Shaker hood, as well as an engine-mounted, high-flow, cold-air induction.\n\n![2019-dodge-challenger-exterior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3rygcDgBImPucH7Qqw82C4/91680ba94dedeb237a7ea81dbfe929f9/2019-dodge-challenger-exterior1.jpg)\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort\n\nThe interior of the 2019 Dodge Challenger has been updated to improve comfort while driving, and for passengers. This vehicle offers performance seats, uniquely designed to fit the contour of your body, while helping the driver remain secure behind the wheel. The seats have been accented with stitching that stands out against the interior color. For the SRT Hellcat Redeye, the SRT Hellcat, and the RT Scat Pack, the Scat Pack Bee logo and the SRT Hellcat Logo are embroidered on the vehicle’s front seats.\n\n![2019-dodge-challenger-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2xG3SNrgT5oXwiPSsKJ8d/ce2781ce4d5c54db567d3186ce99a6d9/2019-dodge-challenger-interior2.jpg)\n\nThanks to the many updates made for this version, drivers can choose from 17 interior colors, as well as between sport seats and performance seats, based on their personal preferences. Additional features offered by the seats include ventilated options that help keep drivers cool, as well as heated front seats for colder months. There's also climate control features for each zone of the vehicle.\n\nSeveral steering wheel designs are available for each of the Challenger trim levels. There are currently four steering wheel options to choose from, including SRT, Wild Wheel, Performance, and Sport. The wild wheel option rivals the older options seen in vintage Chrysler muscle cars. \n\n### Utility \u0026 Practicality\n\nUnlike the Challenger’s main competition, the [Chevrolet Camaro](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-camaro) and the [Ford Mustang](https://www.autolist.com/ford-mustang), the 2019 model has a usable back seat that can hold up to three passengers. There’s also a usable trunk, which is a feature that the competition is missing.\n\n### Technology \u0026 Infotainment\n\nNew technology has been added to the 2019 Dodge Challenger, making driving more connected and convenient. Currently available is the Uconnect 4C NAV. This comes loaded with a wide array of features making it easy for drivers to remain connected and safe on the roads. Some of the top features include hands-free calling, an 8.4-inch touchscreen (which is the largest available in the class), a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and navigation.\n\n![2019-dodge-challenger-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2xG3SNrgT5oXwiPSsKJ8d/ce2781ce4d5c54db567d3186ce99a6d9/2019-dodge-challenger-interior2.jpg)\n\nDriver’s can connect their smartphone to the car by using Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. This allows drivers to gain access to specific apps through the Uconnect touchscreen. Another new feature for the 2019 model is the available Dodge Performance Pages. This provides you real-time stats from overall engine performance to the exerted g-force of the vehicle.\n\nCustomization options are available for the technology included, such as the Heritage Tic-Toc-Tach gauges, which are next to the seven-inch Driver Information Digital Cluster Display, which is reconfigurable. This display arrives custom with a 0 to 60 timer, a lap timer, as well as the option for turn-by-turn navigation.\n\nDodge has provided drivers with two speaker options, including the Alpine audio group, which features nine Alpine speakers, a 506-watt amplifier, and subwoofer. The other option is the Harman Kardon Audio Group, providing 900 watts of power with two subwoofers and 18 speakers.\n\nEasily unlock the doors by pulling the front door handle, as long as the key fob is nearby. Once in the driver’s seat, simply engage the Start/Stop button and press the brake at the same time to start the engine.\n\n### Safety \u0026 Driving Assistance\n\nSafety is standard on the 2019 Dodge Challenger. This starts with advanced driver-assist features. Other features include high-beam headlamps, which can switch automatically from the high-beam setting to the low-beam setting when any ambient light is detected from oncoming traffic is detected. The Blind Spot Monitoring system provides assistance to drivers when making a lane change by providing alerts when another vehicle enters one of the blind spot areas on the vehicle.\n\nAdaptive cruise control adjusts your cruising speed automatically, for both automatic and six-speed manual transmission options, to help keep a certain distance from the vehicle ahead, while full-speed forward collision warning transmits audible warnings, along with visual proximity warnings, and apply the brake when necessary.\n\nBacking up is made simple and safe with the Parkview rear back up camera, allowing you to see what’s behind via the Uconnect screen, which automatically comes on when you shift into refers.\n\nIn addition to the technology safety features, there are several built-in body safety components. This includes crumple zones, designed to absorb any energy and redirecting it away from passengers to mitigate the risk of an injury. Another feature is the solid frame. The Challenger is constructed using high-strength steel, serious roof strength, and a steel safety frame helping to protect the passenger compartment. Airbags are found throughout and considered standard.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Driving Experience \n\nThe SXT and the GT trims are availalbe with the standard with a 3.6 liter, V6 engine, offering 305 horsepower, with a high pound-feet of torque and an estimated EPA of 19/30 mpg for the rear wheel drive and 18/27 for AWD. The optional 5.7 liters, Hemi V8 has two horsepower options, and other engine selections include the 6.4-liter Hemi V8 and the 6.2 liter supercharged Hemi V8, which is standard in the SRT Hellcat. The Challenger Hellcat provides drag strip ready features for drivers. \n\n### Fuel Efficiency \n\nThe Challenger features a 375 horsepower, 5.7L Hemi V8 engine that offers fuel saver technology. With this fuel saver option, you can achieve up to 30 highway mpg, providing a superior fuel economy for the powerful vehicle. \n\n### Pricing and Value\n\nThe 2019 model year of the Dodge Challenger SXT trim has a MSRP starting price of $28,690, including the destination charge of $1,395. You can add all-wheel-drive for an additional $3,000, and the GT starts at just $31,400, including the destination charge. The SXT trim comes standard with the 3.6-liter V6 engine, as well as the Uconnect infotainment system, and 7.0-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth, USB, and auxiliary inputs. There is a total of eight Challenger models, each having basic, standard equipment.\n\nIf you are interested in one of the more powerful trims in the Challenger lineup, the R/T Scat Pack, with the 6.4-liter V8 runs at $41,400, including the destination charge and $1,000 gas-guzzler tax. The Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat is down $5,000 from last year’s mode starting at $61,745.\n\nEach model comes standard with the Hound’s tooth cloth seats, along with the 8-speed automatic transmission for all V6 models, and optional on V8 models.\n\nThe Challenger GT and SXT models add all-wheel drive to the V6 models, and the Challenger R/T has the 5.7-liter VA. The Hellcat Widebody and supercharged SRT Hellcat are directly loaded from the factory, unlike the Demon, the Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat Redeye comes standard with a back seat and it can be upgraded with the same available features offered by the Hellcat.\n\nThe factory loaded SRT Hellcat Redeye has a starting price of $71,695, and the R/T starts at $34,364.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Sedan","Reviews"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/dodge-challenger#year_min=2019\u0026year_max=2019","modified_date":"2019-05-17T17:34:35.554Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6VBKoWTuP14JTJx0m3UdmQ/b08190c6bddc55f29eeb755686acfe9a/2019-chevy-traverse-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1hoGczesBoaw1QbKqhAmkg/fbc96fcdc991b8da74231dd9a2a2fb99/2019-chevy-traverse-325-image.jpg","slug":"2019-chevy-traverse-review","title":"2019 Chevy Traverse Review","publication_date":"2019-05-02T11:48-08:00","content_summary":"The 2019 Chevrolet Traverse is a 3-row, midsize SUV which competes against the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, Kia Telluride, Buick Enclave, and Subaru Ascent.","parent_page":{"name":"Chevy Traverse","description":"Make Model","slug":"chevrolet-traverse"},"categories":[{"name":"Car Review","description":"Autolist Car Review","parentCategory":{"name":"Reviews","description":"Reviews"}}],"category":{"name":"Car Review","description":"Autolist Car Review","parentCategory":{"name":"Reviews","description":"Reviews"}},"author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"body":"### Summary  \n\nThe 2019 Chevy Traverse is a three-row, midsize crossover SUV which is currently in its second generation.  \n\nIt competes with other crossover SUVs like the Ford Explorer, [Mazda CX-9](https://www.autolist.com/mazda-cx+9), [Honda Pilot](https://www.autolist.com/honda-pilot), [Nissan Pathfinder](https://www.autolist.com/nissan-pathfinder), Volkswagen Atlas, [Toyota Highlander](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-highlander), [Subaru Ascent](https://www.autolist.com/subaru-ascent), and [Kia Telluride](https://www.autolist.com/kia-telluride), along with its GM siblings, the [GMC Acadia](https://www.autolist.com/gmc-acadia) and [Buick Enclave](https://www.autolist.com/buick-enclave).  \n\nSome reviewers note that the top trim levels of the Traverse edge into luxury SUV territory with its extensive amount of features, rivaling the [Volvo XC90](https://www.autolist.com/volvo-xc90), [Infiniti QX60](https://www.autolist.com/infiniti-qx60), and [Acura MDX](https://www.autolist.com/acura-mdx).  \n\nThe 2018 Traverse saw a complete redesign, so new features and design elements for 2019 model year are limited to an upgraded wheel option for a few trim levels.  \n\nDespite not adding any significant new features for 2019, the 2018 redesign places the Traverse squarely in the crosshairs of its competition.  \n\nIt offers copious amounts of space, comfort, and family-friendly features. Its choice of trim levels, variety of price points, and plentiful standard features make the Traverse readily available for a wide range of demographics.  \n\n### Exterior  \n\nThe Traverse is a handsome and stylish SUV that falls somewhere between refined and conventional.  \n\n![2019-chevy-traverse-exterior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6IrCVHYba1Jcmov1z7X4iE/f92940e8ccc628d535f296ee2f845707/2019-chevy-traverse-exterior1.jpg)\n\nIt is not as stoic and chiseled as its full-size sibling, the [Chevrolet Suburban](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-suburban), but it also doesn’t look aggressive and sharp like the [Mazda CX-9](https://www.autolist.com/mazda-cx+9) or the [Toyota Highlander](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-highlander).  \n\nLike many other SUVs today, the Travers has a massive grille. Unlike most other SUVs, it doesn’t look abnormal or out of place. Its fascia is well rounded and leads nicely into the side and rear bodywork.  \n\nThe large C-pillar is the most prominent feature on the side of the SUV. The rear window has a concealed D-pillar behind the privacy glass, making it look smooth and continuous.  \n\nA large, squared canopy with soft edges adds to the Traverse’s traditional appearance.  \n\nThe Traverse does not look sporty or athletic. Even the 20-inch wheel upgrade is balanced out by the Traverse’s overall size.  \n\n![2019-chevy-traverse-exterior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6bofby2XlmolngE63RkuuM/731b05931c49375c7dce7836037be080/2019-chevy-traverse-exterior2.jpg)\n\nThe Redline package and RS trim both replace chrome accents with black trim pieces, giving the Traverse a more sporty overall appearance for those who want it.  \n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort  \n\nReviewers praise interior comfort as one of the best in the class.  \n\nThey note that the seats offer good support and comfortable bolstering with plenty of lumbar support. Heated and ventilated seating options on some trim levels add a touch of luxury for both the front seats and second-row seats.  \n\n![2019-chevy-traverse-interior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6oU1HBSNjBI4scRUIMsxLQ/2bfc8c14c4caf1a697dfd3fc298676b1/2019-chevy-traverse-interior1.jpg)\n\nInterior space is best in class and adds to the overall comfort levels. Even the third-row seats can accommodate typically sized adults, which is not the case in most midsize SUVs. Legroom is best in class for both second-row seating and third-row seating, with plenty of headroom as well.  \n\nInterior noise levels suffer slightly from the V6 engine drone at higher speeds but are generally kept at a minimum, according to reviewers.  \n\nInterior quality takes a hit with reused parts from the General Motors parts bin. That aspect bothered many reviewers, especially on the higher trim levels.  \n\nThough some plastic trim pieces and cloth seating is expected on lower trim levels, reviewers expect more from the Traverse, considering that many competitors have more upscale interiors at comparable price points.  \n\n### Utility \u0026 Practicality  \n\nEven with a locking rear differential on the High Country trim level of the Traverse, the only real area of utility lacking in the Traverse is its inability to do some serious off-roading.  \n\nThe Traverse is large enough to accommodate seven adults, has a class-leading 98 cubic feet of storage capacity when the third-row seats are folded down and can tow up to 5,000 pounds when equipped with the Trailering package.  \n\n![2019-chevy-traverse-exterior3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/dlzJJingvdGaH6LaPudxH/727b8b05b0e3c1b310b024700b0764e2/2019-chevy-traverse-exterior3.jpg)\n\nEven when all seats are folded up, the cargo area contains 23 cubic feet of space. Rear liftover height is acceptable, and the load floor is about average height for the class.  \n\nGetting in and out of the Traverse is more accessible than most reviewers expect. The SUV looks higher than it is. Reviewers note that climbing into the third row is also much more comfortable than expected with its SmartSlide second row.  \n\nInterior storage is average for the class with an adequate amount of cup holders and storage compartments scattered throughout the cabin. \n\n![2019-chevy-traverse-interior3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3ofbkRNSnNg0SDHUJStjD6/09f956f04148d08b9215846c47a9f749/2019-chevy-traverse-interior3.jpg)\n\n\n### Technology \u0026 Infotainment  \n\nTechnology and infotainment features are other areas in which the Traverse does well among its competitors.  \n\nA 7-inch touchscreen MyLink infotainment system is standard with an available 8-inch MyLink infotainment system upgrade on higher trim levels. Also standard are Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a Wi-Fi hotspot, OnStar, Bluetooth, and voice controls.  \n\n![2019-chevy-traverse-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6CNH9lENm24K66zHIVRkUQ/381703a486b9b6d76e1823e2f1ee76cf/2019-chevy-traverse-interior2.jpg)\n\nA 10-speaker Bose audio system, rear seat entertainment system, satellite radio, and navigation system are available on higher trim levels.  \n\nNotable technology features include a power liftgate, wireless smartphone charging pads, and tri-zone automatic climate controls.  \n\n### Safety \u0026 Driving Assistance  \n\nSafety and driving assistance features are plentiful, but many are only available on the highest trim levels of the Traverse. These drive the price up quickly if added as optional extras.  \n\nStandard safety features include traction control, electronic stability control, a rearview camera, and Teen Driving System, which allows parents to set vehicle parameters, gather driving data, and even alert them when a collision is detected.  \n\nA full slate of driver assistance aids are available on the Traverse and include low-speed emergency automatic braking, lane departure warning; lane keep assist, rear cross-traffic alert, forward collision warning, emergency pedestrian braking, blind spot monitoring, and parking monitors.  \n\nA LATCH child safety seat system is standard.  \n\nBeyond the active safety features the Traverse offers, the NHTSA also awards it with a five-star overall crash test rating for 2019.  \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Driving Experience  \n\nThe driving experience of the Traverse is more akin to a luxury SUV than a sporty one. Reviewers note that power is adequate, regardless of the engine choice, but the handling is lackluster and uninspiring.  \n\nThe Traverse RS is the only trim which comes standard with a turbocharged 4-cylinder engine. All the rest of the trim levels receive a 3.6-liter V6 engine, which was mostly carried over from previous years but has been upgraded to make more power.  \n\nThe 2.0-liter 4-cylinder turbocharged engine, only available on the RS trim, comes with 257 horsepower and 295 lb-ft. of torque.  \n\nThe 3.6-liter V6 engine, equipped on all trims but the RS, produces 310 horsepower and 266 lb-ft. of torque.  \n\nAll engine options are mated to a 9-speed automatic transmission and are equipped with an engine start-stop system that is unable to be turned off.  \n\nMost reviewers find the engine and transmission combination to work well especially in city driving.  \n\nThe 2.0 liter 4 cylinder engine isn’t as powerful as its V6 counterpart, but its additional torque gives it good off-the-line power. The V6’s extra power also gives it the necessary punch needed to get it moving.  \n\nAcceleration is good for the class with a reported 7.1 second 0-60 mile per hour time.  \n\nAll testers who drive the Traverse universally praises ride quality. It is comfortable and floaty, which testers note is better than almost every other SUV with which it competes.  \n\nThat doesn’t come without drawbacks. With the Traverse’s excellent driving comfort comes a distinct lack of feel, handling ability, and prominent body roll, according to reviewers.  \n\nWhile no reviewers are surprised with this trade-off, it doesn’t affect how most will use the SUV.  Stop-and-go city driving and highway trips rarely require refined vehicle handling and won’t affect many buyers’ purchasing consideration, according to testers.  \n\nSteering wheel feel is noted to be slightly numb but easy to turn. Braking is smooth and linear with a solid feel throughout the pedal travel, according to testers.  \n\n### Fuel efficiency \n\nFuel economy is near the top of the class when compared to its competitors.  \n\nThe 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine provides an EPA-estimated 20 miles per gallon in the city and 26 miles per gallon highway.  \n\nThe 3.6-liter V6 engine provides better fuel economy in highway driving at an EPA estimated 27 miles per gallon but fell short of the smaller engine in city driving with 18 miles per gallon. \n\nAdding the all-wheel-drive option to the V6 engine lowers EPA estimates to 17 mpg in the city and 25 mpg on the highway. The 2.0-liter engine is not available with all-wheel drive.  \n\nTaking the [Toyota Highlander Hybrid](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-highlander+hybrid) out of the equation, the Chevy Traverse falls just short of the [Mazda CX-9](https://www.autolist.com/mazda-cx+9), [Subaru Ascent](https://www.autolist.com/subaru-ascent), and [Honda Pilot](https://www.autolist.com/honda-pilot) for best in class fuel economy.  \n\nThe [CX-9](https://www.autolist.com/mazda-cx+9) has it squarely beat with a 22 mpg city and 28 mpg highway fuel economy estimates. The Traverse matches the [Ascent](https://www.autolist.com/subaru-ascent) and [Pilot](https://www.autolist.com/honda-pilot) in highway fuel economy at 27 miles per gallon, but loses out in city mileage estimates, bringing its overall rating down.  \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Pricing \u0026 Value \n\nThe Chevy Traverse presents a mixed bag of value propositions depending on the trim level selected.  \n\nThe SUV presents a good value if buyers opt for the LS or LT trims. There are a host of standard features equipped on the lower trim levels with some not available on competitors. Several option packages are also available to add non-standard features.  \n\nHigher trim levels of the Traverse, notably the High Country trim, don’t provide as good of value due to the relatively high price tag compared with the competition.  \n\nRegardless of which trim level buyers select, the Traverse remains a slightly better than average value as it provides best in class ride quality, some of the best passenger and cargo space in the class, and good fuel economy.  \n\nIf buyers want an SUV that handles well and that comes with most safety features available on the market today, the Traverse will not present a good value. Even though plenty of safety features are available on the Traverse, they come at a premium price.  \n\nA nine-speed automatic transmission is the only available transmission option for all Traverse models. The 3.6-liter V6 engine is standard on all models except for the RS trim which is powered by the 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine.  \n\nFront-wheel drive is standard on all trim levels except the High Country and is the only available drivetrain option on the base model L and RS trims. All-wheel drive is available for an additional $2000 on all trims except for the base L and RS.  \n\nThe Chevy Traverse is available in seven different trim options:  \n\n__Chevrolet Traverse L:__\n\nThe base Chevy Traverse L starts at just over $31,000 with destination included.  \n\nStandard features include LED daytime running lights, a 7-inch MyLink touchscreen infotainment system, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, tri-zone automatic climate controls, HID Xenon headlights, OnStar, Teen Driver safety system, a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and automatic start-stop system.  \n\nIt should also be noted that the Traverse L can seat up to eight people because the second-row seat is a bench seat rather than split second-row captain’s chairs. It and the next trim level up are the only trim levels to have this feature. All other trim levels can seat up to seven people.  \n\n__Chevrolet Traverse LS:__\n\nThe LS trim starts at just over $34,000 with front-wheel-drive equipped, including destination. All-wheel drive is optional and will bring the price up to $36,000.  \n\nThe LS comes with all the features available with the L trim with the option to add all-wheel drive and a rear seat entertainment system, including tablet mounts.  \n\n__Chevrolet Traverse LT Cloth:__\n\nThe Traverse LT Cloth seating is available starting at just over $36,500 with front wheel drive equipped, including destination. Adding all-wheel drive will bring the price to around $37,750. \n\nThe LT Cloth is equipped with a power-adjustable driver’s seat and roof rails.  \n\nThis trim also adds some available package options which automatically include all-wheel drive.  \nThe Convenience and Driver Confidence package comes with several notable safety features including blind spot monitoring, rear parking sensors, and rear cross-traffic alert. It also adds technology features such as a power liftgate, remote start, heated front seats, and the upgraded 8-inch MyLink infotainment system.  \n\nAlso available is the Trailering package which adds a more robust cooling system and a trailer hitch.  \n\n__Chevrolet Traverse LT Leather:__ \n\nThe LT Leather trim starts at $40,250 with front-wheel drive equipped and includes destination. All-wheel drive brings this price up to around $42,250.  \n\nAll of the Convenience and Driver Confidence package features from the LT Cloth come standard on the LT leather. The Trailering package is still available as an extra as is a panoramic sunroof.  \n\nA premium package is available for the LT Leather which adds a 10-speaker Bose audio system, upgraded 20-inch alloy wheels, a top-down camera, and a rearview camera that shows in the rearview mirror while in reverse.  \n\n__Chevrolet Traverse RS: __\n\nThe Traverse RS is the “sporty” trim among Traverse models and can only be had in front-wheel drive and with the 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine. It starts at around $44,250 with destination included.  \n\nThe Premier package from the LT Leather comes standard on the RS along with distinctive black trim accents that make it look sportier than other Traverse models.  \n\n__Chevrolet Traverse Premier:__\n\nThe Traverse Premier starts at $46,750 with front-wheel drive and destination included.  \n\nThe Premier adds features such as heated second-row seats, ventilated driver and passenger seats, LED headlights, and wireless smartphone and tablet charging pads.  \n\nThe Trailering package is still available as well as a panoramic sunroof.  \n\nAn upgraded Driver Convenience II package adds even more safety features to the regular package such as lane departure warning. Lane keep assist, automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, and forward collision warning are bundled here.  \n\nOpting for all-wheel drive automatically adds both the upgraded Driver Convenience II package and Trailering package.  \n\nA Redline package is also available on the Premier. That is essentially the RS trim with everything mentioned above.  \n\n__Chevrolet Traverse High Country:__ \n\nThe High Country trim is the highest trim level offered on the Traverse and starts at around $54,300 with an upgraded all-wheel-drive system as standard. The all-wheel-drive system comes with a locking rear differential for added utility.  \n\nThe High Country comes standard with all the equipment from the Premier trim along with some additional safety and technology features. These include adaptive cruise control, an automatic folding third-row, hands-free liftgate, and leather upholstery.  \n\nFully-loaded, a Chevy Traverse High Country can top out at over $60,000.

The Corvette also differentiates itself noticably from the [Camaro](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-camaro), another two-seat performance car from Chevrolet. At first glance, it might seem that the Corvette and the [Chevrolet Camaro](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-camaro) occupy the same territory. However, the Corvette sits firmly atop the Chevrolet's food chain and is focused intensely on being able to dominate both the street and the track. \n\nFor 2019, the Corvette comes in four versions: the base Stingray, Grand Sport, Z06, and the brand new ZR1. The Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 is the most powerful Corvette ever created by Chevrolet, churning out 755 horsepower from its supercharged 6.2-liter V8 engine. It can reach 60 mph from a standstill in 3 seconds, and continues on to a 212 mph top speed.\n\n### Exterior\n \nMany reviewers agree that the 2019 Corvette is a striking and handsome vehicle even in base trim: that long hood and short trunk area are classic Corvette design elements. The new ZR1 trim level add numerous visual elements that increase the Corvette's aggressive style dramatically: it has a wide grille, carbon fiber aerodynamics, an absolutely massive rear wing, and a tall bulging hood that uses functional vents to keep the engine bay cool.\n\n![2019-chevy-corvette-exterior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2hVd1bE3JGtDTM3lsgTx9T/85205093d84c84d07dc2226ff11bb9d4/2019-chevy-corvette-exterior1.jpg)\n\nThe Corvette rides on a platform that’s noticeably smaller than its main American rivals, the Dodge Challenger and Ford Mustang. Where those cars are 197.5 inches and 188.3 inches respectively, the Corvette is 179.8 inches. Curb weight for the base Corvette is also impressively light, weighing in at only 3,298 pounds.\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort\n\nPrevious generations of the Corvette have been criticized by reviewers for its lack of refinement and material quality, but the C7 Corvette has an interior that represents a significant improvement over past models. The entire dashboard is turned slightly towards the driver making it easier for them to access the car's controls. Interior space is relatively plentiful: there are 43 inches of leg room, 53.7 inches of hip room, and 37.9 inches of head room. \n\n![2019-chevy-corvette-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5Oq9cSVewPtiZOtOJ56Oq4/78d91ed24be83a4a154cd7dfb1c5125d/2019-chevy-corvette-interior2.jpg)\n\nWhile creature comforts might not spring mind when one things of a performance car, but the Corvette is reasonably well appointed in this area. It has full climate control, heated and ventilated sport seats which are well bolstered and designed to keep both driver and passenger in place under hard cornering, leather and Alcantara are used generously throughout the interior, as well as optional carbon fiber and aluminum, and the dashboard is clean and intuitive.\n\n### Utility and Practicality\n\nWhile the Corvette won’t ever be confused for anything other than a true sports car, it does offer decent practicality. The trunk provides 15 cubic feet of storage space and there are numerous storage pockets and bins throughout the cabin.\n\n![2019-chevy-corvette-exterior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/ae4PrpGtojnyNeg1IiHRQ/dd103cfa24e85b4ebdc4a7c99d98c469/2019-chevy-corvette-exterior2.jpg)\n\n### Technology and Infotainment\n\nEvery iteration of the Corvette features an 8 inch touchscreen infotainment system in the center of the dash, OnStar, 4G WiFi capability, Bluetooth connectivity, Apple CarPlay, and a backup camera. Higher-end trims add navigation, a 10 speaker Bose sound system, Sirius satellite radio, a curb view camera, a performance data recorder, and heads-up display.\n\n![2019-chevy-corvette-interior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2fRc5D59JqAlAn9e22iPYt/87c7845796cb3b152b8b50cedc0a24fc/2019-chevy-corvette-interior1.jpg)\n\n### Safety and Driving Assistance\n\nChevy has equipped the Corvette with ABS, stability control, traction control, and front and side impact airbags. In more premium versions of the car and with certain options packages, owners can opt for super strong Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes which stop the car with greater force and in shorter distances than the standard brakes. Not only are those characteristics great for on track performance, but they're helpful for street driving as well.\n\n### Driving Experience\n\nAs you might expect, the driving experience in the 2019 Corvette is an impressive one. Critics and reviewers praise the Corvette’s incredible power, sticky Michelin tires, excellent handling, and incredible exhaust note. Most versions of the Corvette can be equipped with Chevrolet’s Magnetic Selective Ride Control system which actively reads the road surface every millisecond and adjusts the suspension accordingly. Cars with magnetic ride control provide sharp, responsive handling, and according to road tests, really take the Corvette to the next level.\n\nPowering the 2019 Corvette is an aluminum 6.2-liter V8 engine. Both the Stingray and Corvette Grand Sport produce an impressive 460-horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque. Stepping up to the Z06 unlocks 650-horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque thanks to supercharging. And the new ZR1 provides drivers with 755-horsepower and 715 lb-ft of torque.\n\nWhile technically the “base” car, the Corvette Stingray still gets to 60 mph in only 3.7 seconds. The Grand Sport does it slightly quicker, reaching the same speed in 3.6 seconds. The Z06’s increased power means it hits 60 mph in only 2.95 seconds, while the ZR1 takes an even 3 seconds. \n\nThe Corvette can be equipped with either a 7 speed manual transmission with Active Rev Matching, or an 8 speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters. There’s also a Z51 performance package that adds performance elements like stiffer suspension, a limited-slip differential, slotted brake rotors, high performance tires, and a multimode exhaust system that actually increases power output slightly.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Fuel Efficiency\n\nAnother impressive element of the Corvette is fuel economy. Thanks to longer gearing in the transmission, the Stingray and Grand Sport both achieve 16/25 MPG city/highway, the Z06 gets 15/22 MPG city/highway, and the ZR1 manages 13/19 MPG city/highway. When you consider how much power the Corvette makes and its focus on performance, those numbers are remarkable.\n\n### Pricing and Value\n\nOne of the Corvette’s most attractive elements is its value. For years reviewers have lauded the Corvette’s ability to provide such a high level of performance for comparatively little money. In most cases, one would need to spend significantly more to achieve the same results that the Corvette offers. And that is true whether you're talking about the base car or the incredible ZR1.\n\nChevrolet offers the Corvette in a wide range of trims and configurations. In addition to choosing between the coupe and convertible versions, it’s possible to buy the base car and add thousands worth of visual and performance upgrades, or to take the top-tier trims to even greater heights.\n\nBase price for the Chevrolet Corvette Stingray 1LT Coupe is $56,995, while the convertible's MSRP is $61,495. Choosing the 1LT with the Z51 Performance Package which adds performance items like a dry sump oil lubrication system and electronic limited-slip differential, will set you back $61,590.\n\nThe 2LT trim level adds a number of convenience and comfort items and is $61,450 for the coupe, and $65,950 for the convertible. Include the Z51 package, and prices increase to $66,450 and $70,950 respectively.\n\nThe 3LT trim level includes more interior leather and other performance enhancements. The 3LT coupe is $66,740 and the convertible runs $71,240. Adding the Z51 package results in $71,740 for the coupe and $76,240 for the convertible.\n\nTrim levels for the Grand Sport are similar to the Stingray.  The 1LT coupe starts at $66,995, the convertible is $71,495. Go for the 2LT trim and prices rise to $71,450 for the coupe and $75,950 for the convertible. And finally, the 3LT iteration of the Grand Sport starts at $76,740 for the coupe while the convertible is $81,240.\n\nPrices for the Z06 1LZ coupe begin at $81,995 while the 1LZ convertible is $86,495. Moving up to the 2LZ package gives the Z06 more creature comforts like the premium Bose stereo. The 2LZ package stickers at $85,560 in coupe form and $90,060 for the convertible.\n\nAnd that brings us to the mighty Corvette ZR1. In base configuration, the ZR1 starts at $121,995 for the coupe version and $126,495 for the drop top. The 3ZR package, like the other packages available for the Corvette, enhances the premium nature of the interior and adds items like auto-dimming mirrors, heated and cooled seats, and embossed logos on those seats. Prices begin at $131,995 for the 3ZR coupe and $136,495 for the convertible.\n\nIn addition to all these trims, Chevrolet also offers numerous packages for the Corvette that add elements above and beyond what are outlined here. One of the most impressive packages is the ZTK Track Package for the ZR1. This $2,995 option includes the large adjustable rear wing, sticker performance tires, different suspension, and even more carbon fiber aerodynamic pieces. Another interested package is the Z07 Performance Package for the Z06. That upgrade gives the car carbon-ceramic brakes, new tires and suspension, and improved aerodynamic elements.\n\nOne look at the Corvette's price in any of its configurations and it's clear that this is a premium sports car. However, the Corvette can compete directly in terms of both price and performance with its American rivals from Ford and Dodge. When it's compared to performance vehicles like the Audi R8 or Porsche 911, the Corvette's price-to-performance ratio becomes even more significant.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-corvette#year_min=2019\u0026year_max=2019","modified_date":"2019-05-17T17:34:35.512Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3Zk5OzPOL6DDlLsSxxzKGu/4b679c6443d86b7e90c53b09890623a0/2019-Toyota-Tundra-Review-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/CSYsHLk9ZzX6NU8pq1nOb/9b850a6061b669058760765fd36983ce/2019-toyota-tundra-325-image.jpg","slug":"2019-toyota-tundra-review","title":"2019 Toyota Tundra Review","publication_date":"2019-04-30T08:42-08:00","content_summary":"The 2019 Toyota Tundra is an American-made full-size pickup.

Originally in production since 1999, this year’s Tundra is part of the third generation of the vehicle released in 2014. \n\nThe Tundra is the first North American full-size pickup truck built by a Japanese automaker to be produced in the United States. Originally produced at the company’s production facility in Princeton, Indiana, since 2008, all Tundras have been built in San Antonio, Texas. \n\nOverall, the 2019 Tundra features a variety of high points such as its standard V8 engine, high ratings for reliability, and reintroduction of the Tundra TRD Pro trim. Many reviewers felt the Tundra was not able to match up against competitors with higher safety ratings, towing capacities and performance. \n\nOriginally debuted in 2015 to compete against the [Ford SVT Raptor](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+150-raptor) and [Ram 1500 Rebel](https://www.autolist.com/ram-ram+pickup+1500), the Tundra TRD Pro is designed for rugged off-road all-terrain driving and ultra-high capacity towing. \n\nThe Tundra TRD Pro features Toyota’s Safety Sense P  and Safety Star Systems. These safety features offer stability and traction control, brake- force distribution adjustments, anti-lock brakes, smart-stop technology, pre-collision alerts, lane departure alerts, automatic high beam lights, sway control and adaptive cruise control. \n\nA high performance shock and suspension system featuring 11 bypass zones for front shocks and 12 for rear, in addition to a small remote reservoir help to keep the Tundra TRD cool and able to haul massive loads. \n\nThe Tundra TRD Pro includes 18- inch BBS alloy wheels, a re designed 1/4-inch-thick front skid plate with a renewed TRD logo, LED headlights with black accent details, dual exist system with black tips, and foglights.\n\nInside, the 2019 Tundra TRD Pro has TRD branded floor mats, leather seats with red accent stitching and unique “TRD” logos on head restraints and shift knob. \n\nThis Tundra trim is available in three colors: Super White, Midnight Black Metallic and Voodoo Blue (exclusive to TRD Pro). This year’s Tundra TRD Pro is also available with an optional moonroof. \n\n### Exterior\n\nThe Toyota Tundra has 18-inch alloy wheels which are perfect for off-road driving. The Tundra exterior also has an aluminum skid plate. This feature adds protection as well as an additional style point.\n\n![2019-toyota-tundra-exterior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1UFytRMZ2p02HOzcHtC8eC/184917415e2913e6525789f51d8a9b09/2019-toyota-tundra-exterior1.jpg)\n\nThe Tundra has tuned dual exhaust system with black chrome exhaust tips. \n\nThe Toyota Tundra is available in: \n\n- Cavalry Blue\n- Voodoo Blue*\n- Midnight Black Metallic \n- Smoked Mesquite\n- Magnetic Gray Metallic\n- Quicksand \n- Cement\n- Silver Sky Metallic\n- Super White\n- Barcelona Red Metallic \n\n*Only available in the Toyota TRP Pro \n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort\n\nThe 2019 Tundra offers a decent amount of comfort for use as a daily driver work vehicle or recreationally focused off-roader. \n\nWhile older versions of this truck were frequently applauded for their largest in class interior space, many reviewers cite redesigned rivals as currently offering massive amounts of space. \n\nThat said, the Tundra is comfortable for 5-6 passengers spread across its front and rear seats. \n\nSome trim levels allow the option to change standard front row bench seats for more comfortable bucket seats. Cloth upholstery, four-way adjustable front seats, and a folding rear-seat bench with a 60/40 split are standard options in this truck.  \n\nSome reviewers found the Tundra’s interior to lack design elements found in similar trucks including Toyota’s own compact truck, the [Tacoma](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-tacoma). They also cited the lack of keyless entry as a possible drawback for some buyers. \n\n![2019-toyota-tundra-interior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6tYpinfYAFexnAhGabutlU/d5228c590fdaa2857e43b1be05892963/2019-toyota-tundra-interior1.jpg)\n\nLeather upholstery, power-adjustable front seats, a leather-trimmed, adjustable steering wheel, and heated seats with ventilation are available as upgrades. The CrewMax cab offers an additional rear-seat legroom by 7.6 inches and adds full-size rear doors.\n\nTundra CrewMax models have a higher rating of “Acceptable” for rear LATCH car-seat connectors than Double Cabs. The two sets of lower anchors for the LATCH system are very easy to locate. The third LATCH connector is located  behind the driver's seat in a position some reviewers described as being placed too deep in the seat cushions.\n\n![2019-toyota-tundra-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3Su4fSX9giUEb127RzYVGr/834cc09c40d08f84f46d042ea111c3f7/2019-toyota-tundra-interior2.jpg)\n\n### Utility \u0026 Practicality\n\nThe 2019 Toyota Tundra, depending on trim level and drivetrain configuration, can tow between 6,400 to 10,200 pounds of cargo. This allows the Tundra to compete against trucks like the [Nissan Frontier](https://www.autolist.com/nissan-frontier), [Ford F-150](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+150), [GMC Sierra 1500](https://www.autolist.com/gmc-sierra+1500), and Chevrolet Silverado. \n\nThe 2019 Toyota Tundra comes with a three-year/36,000-mile basic warranty and a five-year/60,000-mile powertrain warranty. The new car program also offers two years of roadside assistance with an unlimited distance covered. \n\nWith a maximum payload ranging from 1,490 to 1,730 pounds, the Tundra is well suited for many applications. Whether towing a boat or hauling equipment to a job site, the Tundra offers a great deal of utility and practicality. \n\nThe Toyota Tundra has a  Tow Package with added engine and transmission oil coolers. The Tundra has double overhead cams and a dual independent variable valve timing to support heavy duty towing requirements. \n\nThe Tunda with optional 5.7 liter V8 engine also have a Tow/Haul mode which automatically adjusts pulling power, throttle response and braking to ensure safe maneuvering even with excessive loads. \n\nThis truck also has integrated brake and trailer sway controls to make it easier to park the truck while towing a heavy payload. This also improves emergency braking stability\n\nThe 2019 Toyota Tundra includes a variety of features which offer tons of utility and practicality in work, everyday or recreational situations. \n\n![2019-toyota-tundra-exterior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4hbq7MElHrPecnyIdJkyCf/b9eb784982b403f31a7bf97d91c64895/2019-toyota-tundra-exterior2.jpg)\n\n### Technology \u0026 Infotainment\n\nThis year’s Toyota Tundra earned high marks from many reviewers for the standard technology and infotainment components included in base trim levels. Every Tundra features an Entune infotainment system, touch-screen display, voice command system and a well-rounded suite of safety features. \n\nMany reviewers have rated the Entune infotainment platform found in Toyotas to be a well-designed and intuitive system that is easy for nearly all passengers to operate. \n\nUnlike some other cars in Toyota’s 2019 lineup, the Tundra does not support Apple CarPlay  though the upgraded infotainment system available in some trim levels, does allow for smartphone integration with the Entune suite of apps for phones and tablets. \n\nSome reviewers found even the upgraded 7 inch Entune infotainment touch screen to appear small when compared to other systems available on the market today. \n\n### Safety \u0026 Driving Assistance\n\nThe 2019 Tundra received a “Good” rating for its side, moderate overlap front, head restraint and seats from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). The Double Cab trims also received a “Good” rating for it’s roof strength and all trims received a “Superior” score in front crash prevention. \n\nCrewMax Tundras received an “Acceptable” score from the IIHS for it’s roof strength. This is the second highest possible score possible behind “Good”. \n\nThe Tundra also earned “Acceptable” to “Marginal” ratings for the driver-side small overlap front test, and its headlights earned a“Marginal” rating for visibility.\n\nSome reviewers found the Tundra’s less than optimal performance in each of these tests opportunities for this car’s competitors to offer better safety. \n\nEvery Toyota Tundra features a rear view cameras, Toyota Safety Sense P and Safety Star Systems. These safety features offer stability and traction control, brake- force distribution adjustments, anti-lock brakes, smart-stop technology, pre-collision alerts, lane departure alerts, automatic high beam lights, sway control and adaptive cruise control. \n\nOptional safety features in this year’s Toyota Tundra include front and rear parking sensors, rear-cross traffic alerts and blind-spot monitoring. \n\n### Driving Experience\n\nThe 2019 Toyota Tundra is available with a 4.6-liter V8 engine capable of generating 310-horsepower. The 5.7-liter V8 with 381-horsepower is available as an option in the Tundra and Tundra SR. For the Tundra Limited, Platinium and TRD Pro trims, the heavier duty 5.7-liter V8 is standard. \n\nThe Tundra’s standard V8 engines and base horsepower ratings were cited by reviewers as a feature which helps the Toyota stand out against the competition. \n\nReviewers found the Tundra’s handling to excel in the tight cornering situations typical of commercial work sites as well as busy shopping centers. With smooth and reliable braking, the Tundra offers a firm and stable ride. \n\nDesigned to handle rugged, backcountry driving with ease, the Tundra stands up to the task. A stiffer suspension allows for smoother riding over harsh terrain. \n\nThe Tundra has rear-wheel drive with the option to upgrade to four-wheel drive for an additional $3,000. The Toyota TRD Pro trim is only available in the four-wheel drive setup. \n\n### Fuel efficiency\n\nManaging just 15 miles per gallon in the city and 19 on the highway, fuel efficiency is not one of the Tundra’s high points. Reviewers found the Tundra’s V8 engines to offer some of the lowest fuel economy ratings of any full-size pickup truck. The Tundra has a fuel tank capacity of 28 gallons. There is an option to upgrade the fuel tank to 38 gallons. \n\nThough the V8 engine of the Tundra is extremely capable for handling the tough situations it was designed for, it does so a at a cost. When compared to competitors such as the V6 powered Ford F-150, the Tundra offers lower fuel economy and towing capacity. \n\n### Pricing \u0026 Value\n\nThe 2019 Toyota Tundra can be configured in more than 24 ways thanks to possible differences between trims, cab styles, bed sizes, and powertrain upgrades. Starting between $31,520 and $50,530 for the SR, SR5, Limited, Platinum, TRD Pro, the Tundra offers a ton of customization options across its trim levels that all impact pricing and value in their own ways. \n\nThe SR5 and Limited are the only trim levels available with either the Double Cab or CrewMax Cab options. The Tundra SR has a Double Cab as a standard feature. The upper trim’s TRD Pro, Platinum are each only available in a CrewMax Cab. \n\nDouble Cab Tundras are matched with either a 6-foot-6-inch standard bed or 8-foot-1-inch long bed. CrewMax trucks are only available with a 5-foot-6-inch short bed.\n\nThe Toyota TRD Pro, back for 2019 is a great option for those seeking to push a truck through tough off-road driving situations. Reviewers found the Toyota Tundra SR5 CrewMax trim to represent a great value for those looking for a daily driving truck. \n\n__Toyota Tundra SR__\n\nStarting at $31, 520, the 4.6-liter V8 Tundra SR comes with a 6-foot-6-inch standard bed, fabric seats, 18-inch steel wheels, 6.1 inch touch screen infotainment panel, and push-start ignition.  \n\nStandard safety features include adaptive cruise control, pedestrian detection, automatic high beam headlights, and a  pre-collision alert system. \n\nThis trim can be upgraded to include the 5.7-liter V8 engine for an additional $1,270, longer truck bed for $1,6000 and four-wheel drive for $3,050. \n\n__Toyota Tundra SR5__\n\nThe Toyota Tundra SR5 offers an enlarged 7-inch touch screen infotainment panel, halogen fog lights, and satellite radio.

The truck is designed to comfortably seat four to five people and is available with two or four doors. The 2019 model has not changed since this generation of Tacoma was released in 2016. However, the TDR Pro Trim package has a few new additions.\n\nThe Toyota Tacoma is a very sturdy compact pickup truck that has superior off road capabilities. It is designed for everyday use but performs best when off road.\n\nThe Toyota Tacoma is comparable to the [Chevy Colorado](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-colorado), [Nissan Frontier](https://www.autolist.com/nissan-frontier) and the [Honda Ridgeline](https://www.autolist.com/honda-ridgeline).\n\nThe 2019 Tacoma is nearly identical to the 2018 version in terms of safety features and body style. The new Tacoma has two engine choices: a 2.7 liter 4 cylinder 159 horsepower engine or a 3.5-liter v6 with 278 horsepower. The Tacoma features a six-speed automatic transmission. A six-speed manual transmission is available.\n\nAll trim levels now feature two additional USB ports. The TDR Pro Trim package now features a high-mounted snorkel air intake and updated off-road features.\n\n### Exterior\n\nThe body style of the 2019 Toyota Tacoma has not undergone any changes. The body is identical to those used since 2016. The only major differences you will see is that double cabs have an option for a shorter bed.\n\n![2019-toyota-tacoma-exterior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/ICGFfMO6QZH6m6pKwqx02/2014d00a189e2f065abba17e171d29c6/2019-toyota-tacoma-exterior2.jpg)\n\nTrim styles with access cabs are only equipped with 6’1 inch beds. Double cabs have the option of having the standard truck bed or a shorter five foot version. The Toyota Tacoma Limited trim version is only available with the short bed.\n\n![2019-toyota-tacoma-exterior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7aw13FGhuN57h7QTcu4PVY/8f7ab1460c910ee097a27e46ae093685/2019-toyota-tacoma-exterior1.jpg)\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort\n \nThe Tacoma is rated to seat four or five people depending on cab size. The standard cab is designed to allow two people to sit in the rear seat, while the dual cab is designed for five people. Adults may have a harder time getting into the back seat of a standard cab, and there may not be a lot of leg room.\n\n![2019-toyota-tacoma-interior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6mTHpQWmNv7A31xHvAPfBN/4275deef6c15c4d837b8c2d901352e11/2019-toyota-tacoma-interior1.jpg)\n\nCloth is used for the seat coverings in the Tacoma as a standard. Leather seats and heated front seats are an option. The Tacoma has two LATCH connectors in the back seat for securing baby seats. However, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has given this safety system a marginal rating because it is considered difficult to use. However, with the pedestrian detection system, lane departure warning, traction control, and emergency braking, many accidents can be avoided altogether.\n\n### Infotainment System\n\nThe infotainment system is one of the better systems on the market. The standard system comes with an Entune system that has a 6.1 inch touch screen, six speakers, Siri Eyes Free, Bluetooth and three USB ports. The upgraded version has a 7 inch touch screen. You can add-on other extras like jbl speakers, which will make your audio system shine.\n\n![2019-toyota-tacoma-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7f63C8Ud1opve40tVoyak5/1d72954222c25bd5fbdf98571f0d5756/2019-toyota-tacoma-interior2.jpg)\n\nAdditional infotainment features are available such as satellite radio, upgraded speaker systems, built-in navigation and wireless device charging. The Tacoma is the only truck to have a built in GoPro camera mount so that you can record all of your driving adventures.\n\nBuyers can also opt for a moonroof, remote starting, keyless entry and dual-zone climate control.\n\nThe infotainment system is not compatible with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.\n\n### Utility and Practicality\n\nThe interior storage for the 2019 Tacoma is what you would expect from this size of truck. The glovebox and center console are average size and there is a cubby hole in each door. There is limited space under the front seats.\n\nThe crew cab provides additional cargo space. The seat lies flat and has a hard plastic covering which allows you to place heavier objects in this area without damaging the seats. Crew cabs also feature cubby holes under the back seat and has storage space on the back of the front seat.\n\nThe Tacoma rear-wheel drive V-6 is best equipped for towing and has a capacity for up to 6,800 pounds. However, the other trim packages have a towing rate of 6,400 pounds which still makes them a better choice then their competitors. The additional towing package equips the Tacoma with trailer sway control, a larger alternator, wiring for the lights, extra cooling for the engine and of course, the hitch.\n\nThe payload for the Tacoma is what you would expect from this size of truck. However, there are many features about the bed area that make the Tacoma a better option for those who use the bed for hauling.\n\nThe Tacoma bed is covered with a composite material that makes it unnecessary to purchase a bedliner. The sides are a little shorter to allow for better reaching when standing on the ground. The shorter sides, however, are not a deterrent because the bed is equipped with latches all the way around to allow for double stacking of goods.\n\nThe bed has two molded in storage compartments, four moveable tie down cleats and six tie down eyes. There is also an option for a 400 watt 120 volt power outlet to be installed in the bed.\n\n### Safety and Driving Assistance\n\nThe Toyota Tacoma offers several safety features that come standard in all of their trims. These features include:\n\n- Review Camera\n- Toyota Sense Suite\n- Automatic High Beams\n- Pre-Collision Warning and Braking Systems\n- Lane Departure Sensors\n- Pedestrian Warning Sensors\n- Rear Parking Sensors\n- Blind Spot Monitoring\n- Adaptive Cruise Control\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration rated the standard cab a four out of five star rating on rollover accidents and gave the four door cab a five out of five rating. The Tacoma has also received the highest rating for safety from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety based on crash tests.\n\n### Driving Experience\n\nThe Toyota Tacoma is available with either a four cylinder or six cylinder engine. The six cylinder engine performs the best in this vehicle if you are using it for off-road adventures, towing or hauling. The four cylinder engine is better equipped for everyday driving.\n\nThe engine has a little bit of drag to it when you first accelerate. This is present in both size of engines. The 6 cylinder engine was rated as going from zero to 60 in 8.6 seconds, which is comparable to its competition.\n\nThe engine noise is not overbearing and what you would expect in a truck. The automatic transmission can be a little sluggish in city traffic but performs exceptionally in off-road conditions.\n\nIf you are looking to take your vehicle off the pavement regularly, you would be better suited purchasing the TRD Pro Trim package. This package gives you a little more height, better suspension and better tires. The Pro package has a locking rear differential and a Muti-Terrain and Crawl Control feature that allows you to master off-road driving. With 9.6 inches of ground clearance, taking the Tacoma onto the dirt will be easy, and with terrain tires and skid plates and fox shocks, it can be more fun.\n\nThe Tacoma comes with a six speed automatic transmission. A six speed standard is available by special order. The automatic transmission is very powerful for the size of the truck and handles well when towing or carrying a heavy load. However, when on the open road and just driving, the transmission sometimes whines a little when it is trying to switch gears. This trans was built for off road and heavy pulling, so the gear ratio is spaced further apart than your average car.\n\n### Fuel Efficiency\n\nThe Tacoma is ranked low on the EPA fuel economy scale. The four cylinder averages 20 miles in the city and 23 on the highway. The six cylinder averages 19 in the city and 24 on the highway. While better than most full-size pickup trucks such as the [Tundra](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-tundra), these ranking are a little lower then their closest competition. The 2019 [Ford Ranger](https://www.autolist.com/ford-ranger) with a 2.3-liter 4-cylinder engine gives the best mileage in class with 21 mpg in the city and 26 on the highway, while the [Chevrolet Colorado](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-colorado) 2.5 liter, 4-cylinder gets 20 and 26 respectively. \n\nFuel mileage decreases when towing, hauling heavy loads and during some off-road activities.\n\n### Pricing and Value\n\nThe Toyota Tacoma SR has a base price of $25,500. This base price includes the four cylinder engine, cloth seating, basic infotainment system and all the safety systems. Four wheel drive can be added to this package for about $3,100, upgrade to a six cylinder for another $2,250 and add keyless entry for $230.\n\nThe Tacoma SR5 is a better option for just a little more. The SR5 has a base price of $27,325 and includes everything that the SR offers and fog lights, keyless entry without an upcharge, leather wrapped steering wheel, satellite radio and GPS smart phone integration, The crew cab comes standard with a V6 engine and a power sliding back window.\n\nThe Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro and the Tacoma TRD Off Road are very similar in what they offer. The base price for the Tacoma TRD sport is $32,245 and the Off Road is $33,500. Each vehicle comes with a standard V6 engine and has all of the upgraded remote features. Upgraded infotainment system is standard. Each of these vehicles also has upgraded safety features.\n\nThe Toyota Tacoma Limited comes with all the features found in the previous four vehicles and has a base price of $37,490. This version of the Tacoma only comes with the crew cab and the short bed.\n\nThe Tacoma TRD Pro has a base MSRP of $42,260. This vehicle has all of the features that you want for the ultimate off road experience. All features found in the previous five vehicles are features in the TRD Pro. You have the option to chose between the standard (6’1) bed or the short (5’) bed.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/toyota-tacoma#year_min=2019\u0026year_max=2019","modified_date":"2019-05-16T23:50:23.405Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6jJU50pRdHgDJughrEU3Rs/47032e7aa285887f09ed6448ab20205f/2019-honda-civic-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3q5pHkq5fp6Ip5pAf8CVb/8ad48011e3a86d5f28323d0c84d5d095/2019-honda-civic-325-image.jpg","slug":"2019-honda-civic-review","title":"2019 Honda Civic Review","publication_date":"2019-04-26T13:31-08:00","content_summary":"The 2019 Honda Civic is a compact car that is aimed at budget conscious buyers who want a vehicle with usable space and engaging driving dynamics.","parent_page":{"name":"Honda Civic ","description":"Honda Civic Make-Model Page","slug":"honda-civic"},"categories":[{"name":"Car Review","description":"Autolist Car Review","parentCategory":{"name":"Reviews","description":"Reviews"}}],"category":{"name":"Car Review","description":"Autolist Car Review","parentCategory":{"name":"Reviews","description":"Reviews"}},"author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"body":"### Summary\n\nThe 2019 Honda Civic is a compact car that is available as a coupe, hatchback, or sedan, and is one of the longest-running vehicles in Honda’s lineup. The 2019 Civic Coupe and Civic Sedan are offered in five trims: LX, Sport, EX, EX-L, and Touring. Hatchback models are also available in Sport Touring trim. There are two stand-alone sportier models: the Civic Si and Civic Type-R. The Civic is aimed at young people and families that want a budget-friendly and economical car with sporty styling and generous standard features. It competes with cars like the [Toyota Corolla](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-corolla), [Hyundai Elantra](https://www.autolist.com/hyundai-elantra), and [Volkswagen Jetta](https://www.autolist.com/volkswagen-jetta).\n\nNow in its tenth generation, the Civic has been updated for 2019 to include trim level changes, new technologies, and new standard features. There is a new Sport trim level that slots between the LX and EX trims, standard Honda Sensing advanced safety technology, a restyled front end, and a new 7-inch infotainment system for most trims that includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nEven though it is aimed at a mostly younger, more budget-conscious new car buyer, the Civic is available in two high-performance models. The Civic Si, which is more of a middle step toward high-performance, comes with a 205-horsepower engine and sport-themed trim all around. The car has been widely praised as a great value, offering a level of performance and fun that is generally reserved for cars costing much more. \n\nThe Civic Type R is the fastest front-wheel drive car ever made, and has set records for its acceleration and lap times at famous race tracks around the world. The car has a 306-horsepower version of the four-cylinder engines found in other Civic models and comes with sport-tuned suspension, a louder and higher-performance exhaust, comfortable sport seats and an aggressive aerodynamics package. Both the Civic Si and Civic Type R are offered with a manual transmission only. The Civic Si can be purchased as a coupe or a sedan, but the Type R is available only as a five-door hatchback. Because of its large rear space, the car is also very practical.\n\n### Exterior\n\n![2019-honda-civic-exterior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/450wEUuR9ZNWVODo1QHd46/8897c649f2aa588cb12d95220856fab6/2019-honda-civic-exterior1.jpg)\n\nThe Civic’s exterior has been updated for 2019 to include a more aggressive and sportier front end. The lower bumper is designed to give the Civic a wider look and the headlights have been blacked out. Both the Sedan and Coupe have a new grille look that is blacked out and glossy.\n\nThe Touring trim receives a new LED headlight design that is designed to give them wider and longer beams, and the trim level also sees updated chrome accents on the front and rear bumpers.\n\nThe 2019 Civic Si has been updated with a new Tonic Yellow Pearl color.\nThe Civic Type R has been noted by some critics as having busy, polarizing styling, and the exterior appearance of this trim has not changed for 2019. Many others find the Type R’s styling to be fitting of its performance level and of its target audience: younger performance-seeking car buyers. Notably, the Type R is a five-door hatchback design, which sets it apart from most of the rest of the Civic lineup.\n\n![2019-honda-civic-exterior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1wGG3RNBIhKZtlbOaRKMxH/8d75d4076a033df0d054249b0bcac10d/2019-honda-civic-exterior2.jpg)\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort\n\nMuch like the exterior, the Civic’s cabin has been gently updated for the 2019 model year. The steering wheel has been redesigned to be more intuitive, cupholders been made larger, and dash trim pieces are new for all trims. Honda says that the Civic now has more sound insulation in the floor, trunk and the fenders.\n\n![2019-honda-civic-interior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2xnVtpckejZGhQlDjrI8kT/8895f8e9f2e8d8e22fe5dfd54c03f4f5/2019-honda-civic-interior1.jpg)\n\nThe latest generation Civic, last fully updated for the 2016 model year, has been praised for incorporating many of the larger Honda Accord’s premium features into a smaller and less expensive package. Critics note that the front seats are firm, supportive, but comfortable for longer rides.\n\nEven as a compact sedan or coupe, the Civic’s back seat remains usable by adults, though many will find a harder time entering and exiting the coupe’s rear seat. The rear seat’s usable space is also very good, making it easier to load and unload a car seat.\n\nControls are well thought out and intuitive and all are easily accessible by the driver. Being a somewhat budget-oriented car, the Civic’s interior is constructed well, even if there is quite a bit of hard plastic throughout. Higher trims are equipped with soft-touch materials that lend the Civic a more premium feel.\n\nBoth performance versions of the Civic, the Si and Type R, have earned high praise for their very sporty but very comfortable interiors and rides. Critics say that the seats in both are well-suited to spirited driving, even on a track, but remain comfortable for long drives and work well for a wide variety of body types.\n\n### Utility and Practicality\n\nThe Honda Civic’s cargo space and usable storage areas make it one of the best cars in its class. The trunk has 15.1 cubic feet of space and the tall storage area makes carrying larger items like golf bags or suitcases much easier. The rear seats fold down to accommodate long cargo that won’t fit in the trunk alone, but do not fold completely flat. This is especially true in Honda Civic Sedans, where rear space is more generous.\n\nThe Civic Hatchback earns good reviews for its rear cargo area, which is large enough for most bags and other items. The seats also fold in this configuration to allow for longer item storage.\n\n![2019-honda-civic-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/21N4P7bGtzTNESKAl9mVAU/394ebc1d0ea8414295f0e2d42fe35c51/2019-honda-civic-interior2.jpg)\n\nThe Civic’s interior has been equipped with small storage areas in each door, large enough to hold a water bottle and other small items. The center console storage area is segmented into a large bottom cubby and a smaller tray on top, which accommodates items of all sizes with ease. There’s a cord pass-through for cellphone charging as well. Cupholders in both the front and back seats have been praised by critics for their ability to hold very large drinks.\n\n### Technology\n\nHonda’s infotainment systems have been panned by critics for their lack of volume knobs, which made adjustments very difficult. The knob has been added back for the 2019 model year on all trims, and the infotainment unit itself has been updated for higher trims to include Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. All Civic trims also receive a new 7-inch digital TFT display in the instrument cluster. All models also come with USB ports and Bluetooth connectivity.\n\nCivic Touring models come with navigation, voice recognition, and HD digital traffic information.\n\nThe Civic is available with a premium audio system, but even the entry-level sound system found in the LX model benefits from strong sound insulation and a well-designed interior speaker layout.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Safety \u0026 Driving Assistance\n\nThe 2019 Honda Civic now includes Honda Sensing advanced safety features at all trim levels. This brings a collision mitigation braking system, a road departure mitigation system, adaptive cruise control, and a lane keeping assist system with lane departure warnings.\n\nBoth the Civic Sedan and Civic Coupe have been rated as “Good” in most categories by the IIHS. This includes front/side/rear impact testing, roof strength, head restraints, and seats. Front crash prevention is rated as superior. The Civic’s headlights were rated as poor.\n\nThe Civic Sedan and Civic Coupe also scored a five-star crash test rating with the NHTSA.\n\n### Driving Experience\n\nThe base two trim levels, LX and Sport, come with a 2.0-liter i-VTEC engine that has 158 horsepower and 138 pound-feet of torque. These models are available with a six-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). This engine, while larger than the optional powerplant, produces less power and torque. Even so, it has been praised as being responsive and peppy, with plenty of power for most drivers’ needs.\n\nHonda Civic EX, EX-L, and Touring trims come with a turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine that has 174 horsepower and 162 pound-feet of torque. These cars only come with the CVT transmission. Civics equipped with this engine are noted as having strong acceleration and ample low-end power from the turbocharger. With this engine, the Civic has a 0-60 mph time of under seven seconds. Under heavy acceleration, the CVT shifts hard, but is otherwise very smooth.\n\nAll Civics are noted as having a smooth and refined ride that is controlled under most circumstances. Braking distance is better than average for the segment and steering feel is precise with a natural feel. Most reviewers have positive impressions of the standard Civic’s driving manners, especially as it compares to other vehicles in the segment.\n\nThe Honda Civic Si is a sport-tuned version of the car that is offered in both Coupe and Sedan configurations. The car’s up-tuned 205-horsepower engine is paired to a six-speed manual transmission only and the car has a limited slip differential that greatly increases traction under heavy acceleration and when cornering. The Civic Si has made multiple Top-10 lists for its engaging ride and handling that doesn’t detract from the car’s underlying practicality. The car is rated to run 0-60mph in 6.3 seconds, which combines with its low weight to make for a fun driving experience.\n\nThe Civic Type-R takes performance a step further and has also made critics’ Top-10 lists for its speed and agility. The 306-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder engine and six-speed manual transmissions combine to make the Civic Type-R one of the fastest front-wheel drive cars ever made. Last year, it set the record for the class at the Nurburgring with a blistering time of 7 minutes, 43.8 seconds. The car has earned acclaim, not only because of its power and speed, but for its ability to deliver that speed with minimal turbo lag (how fast the turbo helps deliver power), its sharp handling and comfortable ride. The Type R also uses engineering tricks to reduce the amount of torque steer that the car produces under heavy acceleration, which in front-wheel drive cars is caused when the vehicle’s power causes the drive wheels to move to one side or the other.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Fuel Efficiency\n\nThe Civic, in all forms, is considered to be a very fuel-efficient car. When equipped with the 2.0-liter engine and manual transmission, the Civic has EPA-estimated fuel economy ratings of 25/36/29 for city/highway/combined mpg. With the CVT transmission, those numbers change to 30/38/33 mpg.\n\nCivic models with the upgraded 1.5-liter engine are rated at 31/40/34 mpg. \nThe Civic Si is rated at 28/38/32 mpg, and the Civic Type-R is rated at 22/28/25 mpg.\nThe Civic is not offered as a hybrid for 2019, though many of its competitors are. \n\n### Pricing \u0026 Value\n\nThe Civic, because of its strong performance, variety of available body styles, and well-packaged options, is considered to be a good value.\n\nThe base Civic LX Coupe has an MSRP of $20,650 including an $895 destination fee. This trim has advanced safety technologies, a multi-angle rearview camera, automatic headlights, automatic climate controls, power windows/door locks, cruise control, manual seat adjustments, a 5-inch color LCD, Bluetooth connectivity, and a 160-watt stereo.\n\nCivic Sport models have a starting price of $22,345 for the Coupe with manual transmission. This trim comes with a 7-inch display that has Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, fog lights, a gloss-black spoiler, keyless start, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, and a 180-watt stereo. \n\nCivic EX models start at $24,095 including an $895 destination fee for the Coupe and come equipped with Honda LaneWatch, heated seats, a one-touch power moonroof and dual-zone climate controls. Civic EX-L models come with leather upholstery.\n\nThe Civic Touring Sedan has a starting price of $28,195 including an $895 destination charge and comes with automatic LED headlights, sport pedals, heated rear seats, a power passenger seat, and a 450-watt premium stereo with a subwoofer.\n\nThe Civic Si has a starting price of $25,195 including the $895 destination charge and comes with sport seats, a power moonroof, center-exit exhaust, a wing spoiler, manual seat adjustments, and heated seats.\n\nThe Civic Type-R has a starting price of $36,620 including a $920 and includes adaptive dampers, front sport seats, sport exhaust, and an up-tuned 306-horsepower engine.\n\nThe Civic Si and Civic Type R have been consistently praised for providing an extremely good performance and fun to cost ratio. Critics love the fact that they are powerful cars priced closely to their more pedestrian counterparts. Both high-performance versions of the Civic have made multiple buyer’s choice and critic’s choice lists because of this, and both cars offer performance on par with vehicles costing many thousands of dollars more.\n\n","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Review","Sedan"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/honda-civic#year_min=2019\u0026year_max=2019","modified_date":"2019-05-17T17:34:22.457Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5O3h4kRidb5Jzasg4ere2v/156a1dfa8aa26a78320ab31941397787/2019-honda-cr-v-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3ARAoDyZDdIoN3v5OoSWvj/cd9ed7cc431e4734efbfbd9faecf4166/2019-honda-cr-v-325-image.jpg","slug":"2019-honda-cr-v-review","title":"2019 Honda CR-V Review","publication_date":"2019-04-25T09:01-08:00","content_summary":"The 2019 Honda CR-V is one of the most efficient, comfortable, and useful crossovers on sale today.

The CR-V is aimed at new car buyers that need extra cargo capacity and utility but don’t want a large vehicle.\n\nThe Honda CR-V is offered in four trims: LX, EX, EX-L, and Touring. Honda groups its options packages for the CR-V into trim levels, which makes choosing a vehicle with the right equipment much easier. \n\nAfter having been redesigned in 2017, the CR-V rolls into 2019 relatively unchanged. A new White Pearl paint color was added to the lineup for this year, but all engine and trim choices remain. The CR-V has been at or near the top of many reviewers’ “must-buy” lists for years and continues its successful run for the new model year. Critics praise the Honda for its long list of tech equipment, strong fuel economy numbers, and generous cargo space. The CR-V also wins points for its smooth driving feel and modern styling.\n\nThe CR-V has been on sale in North America since 1997 and is now in its fifth generation. Originally produced in Japan, it has been made in various places across the United States and Canada since 2007. Until recently, the CR-V was Honda’s smallest SUV, sitting below the Pilot in the automaker’s lineup. Now, the CR-V is more of a middle child in the SUV lineup, larger than the HR-V and smaller than the Pilot and new Passport SUVs.\n\nThe latest CR-V shares a global design platform with the Honda Civic. Unlike the front-wheel drive compact sedan, the CR-V is offered with optional all-wheel drive. This design is credited with giving the CR-V car-like driving manners and a smooth ride, while also bringing the fuel-efficiency of a front-wheel drive biased platform.\n\nThe CR-V has been a sales success for Honda, with nearly 400,000 sold in 2018. It faces stiff competition from vehicles like the Toyota RAV4, which has been completely overhauled for 2019. Since its last major update took place for the 2017 model year, the CR-V will likely be at least partially refreshed for 2020.\n\n### Exterior\n\nThe 2017 overhaul brought sharp modern styling to the CR-V, which included LED daytime running lights, and 18-inch alloy wheels for EX trim and higher. Compared with the vehicle before it, the latest generation CR-V has a longer hood with more aggressive front-end features, a shorter rear overhang, and more ground clearance. Honda also stretched the wheelbase by 1.6 inches, which improved interior space and ride quality.\n\n![2019-honda-cr-v-exterior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3Fr1GQGE5kfuInzWsoIPw6/cb0d958ef668b5126d14285670c5b5f3/2019-honda-cr-v-exterior1.jpg)\n\nHonda’s exterior design choices also have impacts on fuel economy and driving dynamics. The CR-V is available with an active shutter grille system that can open and shut portions of the grille to improve aerodynamics.  Other vehicles have this feature, particularly high-end models, but the CR-V is the first Honda vehicle with the technology. The A-pillars have also been slimmed down to improve outward visibility in front of the vehicle. Honda also designed the CR-V’s doors and rear hatch to be as large as possible for easier loading and unloading of people and cargo.\n\nReviewers give the new CR-V high marks in the styling department, noting that the muscular look and slightly longer proportions are upscale, clean, and attractive. Most exterior options are tied into trim level choices, but Honda does offer accessories for the CR-V that include roof rack crossbars, a bike attachment, door visors, body side molding, and special fender emblems.\n\n![2019-honda-cr-v-exterior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4m0y1Ux084cQJoCSgwU73j/db397adcae1dc880cde1813c0587ef1c/2019-honda-cr-v-exterior2.jpg)\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort\n\nThe CR-V is a two-row, five-passenger crossover and is one of the roomiest vehicles in its class. Critics note that the CR-V makes clever use of the space, with thoughtfully-placed storage areas.\n\nThe front seats are well-padded and easily adjustable to a wide variety of body shapes and sizes. Reviewers like that the driver’s seat and steering wheel adjustments make it easy to quickly find a comfortable driving position. From the front, outward visibility is very good, with very few obstructions and small blind spots.\n\n![2019-honda-cr-v-interior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3IxaEbvOdcQPnYVwtUKAGy/0d2de1ba2bd27bb2c42b7a29d9f5cbba/2019-honda-cr-v-interior1.jpg)\n\nBoth rows of seating in the CR-V are large and comfortable enough for adults to ride without issue. Taller drivers may find that their knees bump into the center console area, but elsewhere foot room is more than adequate. The CR-V’s gently sloping roofline helps increase head room for second row passengers.\n\nCR-V LX and EX models come with cloth upholstery that is soft and comfortable, while EX-L and Touring trims come with leather upholstery. Reviewers note that even the base cloth material feels premium.\n\nThe 2019 CR-V wins high marks with reviewers for its well-constructed interior with clean styling touches. Though most options and features are wrapped into the various trim levels, there are a few standalone interior options available, like all-season floormats and cargo mats that protect the carpet from wet and muddy feet, illuminated door sill trim that lights up and protects the paint from scuffs, and rear seat covers.\n\n### Utility \u0026 Practicality\n\nThe CR-V is considered to be one of the most practical vehicles on sale today. It has been designed for maximum utility and ease of use with features like a configurable center console with a deep storage area and a sliding tray inside. Reviewers like the CR-V’s large cupholders, deep door pockets and small-item storage.\n\nThe CR-V features over 39 cubic feet of rear storage space, placing it at the top of its class and close to a few much larger vehicles. With the rear seats folded down, the CR-V has over 75 cubic feet of cargo space, and the cargo floor is height-adjustable to allow for more space. Available accessories for the cargo area, include a cargo organizer, cargo tray, or cargo net. These options make the space even more usable and help keep smaller items from rolling around when driving.\n\nThe back seats have all been equipped with LATCH anchors, which means that a car seat can be installed in any position. Critics note that the large rear door openings allow for easy loading and unloading of children and makes it easier for people with limited mobility to enter and exit the vehicle.\n\n![2019-honda-cr-v-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1zJeJe7GU1AOdeJlhvYt6t/7bfdf267a2d87e79da595c7937c6d821/2019-honda-cr-v-interior2.jpg)\n\nThe CR-V can tow 1,500 pounds, which is enough for a small boat or trailer.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Technology \u0026 Infotainment\n\nAll but the base LX trim come with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which brings features like music and media, navigation, and hands-free texts/calls into the dash of the CR-V. All trims come with two USB ports up front and most trims have another two in the rear. \n\nHonda made a controversial decision to remove the volume knob from some of its vehicles’ infotainment units, but the CR-V still has one – a feature many critics call out specifically. The user interface has also been noted as being slightly clunky and awkward to use, but Apple CarPlay and Android Auto make use much easier. The CR-V also has available voice commands, but reviewers recommend using the Apple or Android voice recognition, if available.\n\nA five-inch LCD screen is standard for LX trim, along with a 160-watt audio system. This trim also comes with Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, Pandora compatibility, and 12-volt outlets.\n\nAll other models get a seven-inch touchscreen. The CR-V EX comes with a 180-watt, six-speaker sound system and the EX-L gets eight speakers. The top two trims come with a 330-watt, nine-speaker system and subwoofer. EX and higher trims come with SiriusXM radio capabilities, SMS texting functions, and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto. Navigation is available for the top Touring trim only.\n\nThe CR-V is also available with a driver information interface. EX and higher trims have the ability to display audio settings, a trip computer, phone status, a digital speedometer, and a driver attention monitor within the gauge cluster.\n\n### Safety \u0026 Driving Assistance\n\nThe 2019 Honda CR-V is considered to be a safe vehicle. In IIHS crash tests, the CR-V scored “Good” marks for driver- and passenger-side impact protection, roof strength, and head restraints. When equipped with the available Honda Sensing tech that includes automatic emergency braking, the CR-V also scored a “Superior” rating for front crash prevention. \n\nHeadlights and child seat ease of use were both graded as “Acceptable”. These results are good enough for the CR-V to receive a Top Safety Pick rating from the IIHS.\nThe NHTSA has not yet rated the 2019 CR-V.\n\nThe CR-V is available with the latest in advanced safety technologies. Starting with the EX trim, the CR-V comes with Honda Sensing technology, which includes a collision mitigation emergency braking system that applies the brakes when the vehicle senses that a collision is unavoidable and a road departure mitigation system that can help steer the CR-V back into its lane if it detects that the vehicle is drifting across lines on the road. Other features include adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist, which helps center the CR-V in its lane. All models also have a rearview camera, with EX and higher trims getting dynamic gridlines that move with the vehicle.\n\n### Driving Experience\n\nThe CR-V LX comes standard with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that has 184 horsepower and 180 pound-feet of torque. All other trims come with a 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that has 190 horsepower and 179 pound-feet of torque. All models come with a continuously variable transmission (CVT).\n\nWhen equipped with the 1.5-liter engine, the CR-V has been praised for its acceleration and fuel economy. Critics note that while most SUVs struggle with smaller engines, the turbocharged four-cylinder in the CR-V provides plenty of low-end power for city driving and is capable of easily reaching highway speeds for merging and passing.\n\nReviewers like the CR-V’s transmission, noting that the CVT behaves more naturally in the Honda than in other vehicles. Full-throttle acceleration can cause the engine to wail, though, which is a common trait of vehicles with CVTs.\n\nRide quality is excellent and thought it isn’t a sports car, critics like that the CR-V can handle itself competently on curvy roads. The suspension soaks up all but the worst bumps and body roll is minimal. \n\nThe CR-V is not designed to be an off-road vehicle, but models equipped withall-wheel drive have 8.2 inches of ground clearance. This makes the vehicle more capable in deep snow and on muddy or rutted surfaces. \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Fuel efficiency\n\nThe CR-V is considered to be a very fuel-efficient crossover, even though a hybrid model is not offered. Others in the class, like the [Toyota RAV4](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-rav4) and the upcoming 2020 [Ford Escape](https://www.autolist.com/ford-escape) are (or will be) available with hybrid drivetrains that increase their fuel economy, but the CR-V is still competitive – especially with the 1.5-liter engine.\n\nWhen equipped with the 2.4-liter engine and front-wheel drive, the CR-V has EPA-estimated fuel economy ratings of 26/32/28 mpg city/highway/combined. With all-wheel drive, those numbers change to 25/31/27 mpg.\n\nWith the 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder and front-wheel drive, the CR-V’s fuel economy ratings are 28/34/30 mpg city/highway/combined. When upgraded with all-wheel drive, fuel economy ratings change to 27/33/29 mpg.\n\n### Pricing \u0026 Value\n\nThe CR-V is consistently rated as one of the best, most value-packed vehicles on the market. Critics praise it for being well-equipped in any trim level, and while the base LX trim is considered a good value, most reviewers recommend buying the EX trim, which is one step up. This model includes upgrades over the LX trim that include heated seats, a power moonroof, and advanced safety features.\n\nThe CR-V LX has an MSRP that starts at $25,395 including the $1,045 destination charge and comes with LED daytime running lights, fold-flat rear seats, 17-inch wheels, automatic climate controls, remote entry, USB inputs, and Bluetooth. Adding all-wheel drive increases the price by $1,400.\n\nThe CR-V EX has an MSRP that starts at $28,295 including the $1,045 destination charge and comes with a more powerful and efficient 1.5-liter turbocharged engine, Honda Sensing advanced safety tech, remote engine start, a one-touch power moonroof, a 12-way power adjustable driver’s seat, heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate controls, auto high-beam headlights, and smart keyless entry with auto lock.\n\nThe CR-V EX-L has an MSRP that starts at $30,795 including the $1,045 destination fee and comes with leather upholstery, a power tailgate, a power-adjustable passenger’s seat, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, memory driver’s seat, and an upgraded eight-speaker sound system.\n\nThe CR-V Touring has an MSRP that starts at $33,795 including the $1,045 destination charge and comes with automatic LED headlights, a hands-free power tailgate, rain sensing windshield wipers, navigation, roof rails, an upgraded nine-speaker sound system, and dual chrome exhaust tips.\n","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Review","CUV"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/honda-cr+v#year_min=2019\u0026year_max=2019","modified_date":"2019-05-17T17:34:22.488Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/73igjYb7MEiu3zwzZiQGKZ/b5142dd103c5995502ed52d74477cb81/2019-ram-1500-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7DDyPhPos6dSh18ozHTVB2/1f016e2235ca8a2c899a94de10eb6a80/2019-ram-1500-325-image.jpg","slug":"2019-dodge-ram-1500-review","title":"2019 Dodge Ram 1500 Review","publication_date":"2019-04-24T13:44-08:00","content_summary":"The new 2019 Dodge Ram 1500 comes in several trim options, providing power and towing capacity unparalleled in the full-size class of vehicles.

In fact, it’s the third best-selling vehicle in the U.S., just coming in behind the Ford F-Series, specifically the [Ford F-150](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+150) and the Chevrolet Silverado. Considering the popularity of these trucks, that's a pretty big achievement.\n\nThe 2019 Ram 1500 is considered a great “all-around” truck. As such, it appeals to a wide array of buyers. The Ram is able to set itself apart from the competition (think [F-150](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+150), [Tundra](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-tundra), and Silverado) thanks to the upscale interiors, excellent infotainment system, and coil-spring suspension, which have all been updated for this year's model. \n\nWhen it comes to new and fresh, you’ll love the 2019 Dodge Ram 1500 as it’s been completely redesigned, offering a more capable, more efficient, more comfortable, stronger and lighter truck than ever seen from this company in the past.\n\nTo be more specific, the truck is 225 pounds lighter than last year’s model, features an aluminum tailgate, engine mounts, and steering system, and the max payload has increased to 2,300 pounds. You can choose from several engine options including the 5.7-liter V8 or the 3.6-liter V6. Both the new engines feature the new and powerful eTorque mild hybrid systems.\n\nWhen it comes to tech, there have been innovations here too, including a large 12-inch touch screen, bringing easy-to-see and use technology right into your cab.\n\n### Exterior\n\n![2019-ram-1500-exterior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5fMVzp8VCLkaCfEn3ZvLsf/98199cde25970b5b66db9005ee64633e/2019-ram-1500-exterior2.jpg)\n\nThe frame of the Ram 1500 is made of 98 percent high strength steel. This material has helped to enhance the rigidity of the vehicle and reduce the weight by approximately 100 pounds. This, combined with the use of more aluminum throughout the body, has helped to effectively lighten the 2019 model by a huge 225 pounds.\n\nThis more robust chassis also contributes to the vehicle’s overall dynamics, along with a boosted work ethic. Some of the exterior design remodels have led to the FCA characterizing the new Ram as the most aerodynamic of all full-size pickup trucks (including models from Ford and Chevy).\n\nThe chassis mentioned above is supported by the new generation of the pneumatic suspension, with features including improved off-road performance, load leveling, and Frequency Response Damping.\n\nIf you enjoy spending time off the beaten path, then the new Off-Road package is right for you, which includes hill descent control, retuned damping, locking rear differential, and a one-inch suspension lift kit.\n\n![2019-ram-1500-exterior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1O0LUxLI0kLpyR7mpLfL0p/b59187e70aeffaaba4670a645564a5e9/2019-ram-1500-exterior1.jpg)\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort\n\nWhen it comes to rugged power and premium comfort, the 2019 model of the Dodge Ram 1500 delivers. Not only are drivers surrounded by luxury, passengers are too.\n\nEach model, the Laramie, Big Horn/Lone Star, Longhorn, Warlock, Express, and Tradesman comes with its own set of distinctive colors, interior details, and premium materials, allowing you to customize the interior of your new Ram. In addition to offering a wide array of options for the look of your truck’s interior, there is also ample storage. You will find plenty of pockets and cubbies to keep gear, tools, and anything else you may need. If you opt for the crew cab option, you have even more storage than the other trims. You'll never run out of storage space when you opt for the latest model of the Ram 1500.\n\n![2019-ram-1500-interior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5I7JdxuY9dyf136LUkWtuZ/cf62ba5102ec8786c0c66d41dda4f367/2019-ram-1500-interior1.jpg)\n\nPerhaps the most impressive feature is the Uconnect 4C NAV that comes with an 8.4-inch touchscreen, as well as HD radio, 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, Apple CarPlay and more. The fact is, the features list is so vast, it's impressive to even industry experts.\n\nThe Texas Laramie Longhorn trim offers etched scrollwork on the metal trim, along with belt buckle closure straps for the seat pockets. The rear seat has been upgraded, providing passengers three additional inches of legroom. Even better – the backseat (like the front) can recline up to eight degrees.\n\n### Utility \u0026 Practicality \n\nThe center console inside the truck is spacious enough to hold a six-pack of cans or a laptop. If you need more space inside, the rear seats flip up, providing you with a flat load floor for any taller items you may need to haul. The RamBins are found under the rear floor and hidden by the floormat, making this the perfect location to keep smaller, must-have items (i.e. first aid kit, jumper cables, etc.) out of sight.\n\n![2019-ram-1500-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4HuNorD3tepd8NpPcCsJ77/a333066b6af581953ac0ca31734af45e/2019-ram-1500-interior2.jpg)\n\nThe RamBox option has returned for 2019, providing you with in-bed storage. The truck’s tailgate is made out of the lightweight aluminum, and it has now been fitted with the lift-assist feature. An innovative addition is the ability to lower the tailgate from the cab or by using your key fob.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Technology \u0026 Infotainment \n\nThe 12-inch vertically set Uconnect infotainment system screen is unlike anything else found in the full-size pickup realm (yes, that’s right – it outshines Nissan, Ford, and Chevy!). Both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are standard with the truck's audio system, along with the onboard Wi-Fi hotspot.\n\nThe in-cab screen is touch sensitive and easy to navigate, offering crisp graphics and large icons. You can run two functions at the same time, allowing you to utilize navigation data or audio while accessing the climate control option.\n\nWhen it comes to charging your devices, the Ram 1500 has you covered. There are several charging options available, with five USB ports Type A, along with four USB-C outlets, two 115-volt ports, a 12-volt outlet, and a wireless charging pad.\n\n### Safety \u0026 Driving Assistance \n\nWith the Ram 1500, you have a smarter way to tow thanks to the blind spot monitoring feature that offers rear cross path detection, along with trailer detection. These features scan the potential areas where you may have blind spots behind your truck to help make sure you can safely maneuver, while automatically accounting for and sensing the length of your trailer. With older trucks, and other brands like Chrysler, Jeep, Chevy, and Ford, you have to do this manually.\n\nSome of the other safety features offered by this model include smart cruising, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, and guided parking, offering perpendicular and parallel park assist. The new 360-degree surround view camera offers you a complete picture of what’s going on around your vehicle, making unloading, hooking up a trailer, loading, and parking easier.  \n\nUp to 98 percent of the steel used in the frame is considered high-strength steel, making this the strongest Ram 1500 ever built. In addition to the strong frame, you also have protection from six standard airbags, providing you with plenty of peace of mind, while the adaptive venting technology in the front passenger and driver airbags help to provide another layer of protection.\n\n### Driving Experience \n\nThe 2019 model of the Dodge Ram 1500 is going to be available in Crew Cab or Quad Cab options. It’s also the only truck in this class to offer the mild-hybrid assist feature.\n\nProvided as a standard option on the 3.6-liter V6 option, eTorque is also going to be available on the 5.7-liter Hemi V8. This 48-volt eTorque motor-generator will provide you with boosts of additional power – in fact, you get 130 pounds/feet of torque. If you add that to the already impressive 410 pounds/feet of torque and 395 horsepower, you have plenty of extra power to ensure safe highway passing, and supplemental power when running your various in-cabin systems while idle.\n\nIf you are planning to travel long distances, you will quickly find the Ram 1500 is one of the most comfortable options available for sale today. This is attributed to the five-link rear air suspension setup. The truck is available in several trim levels, with both two- and four-wheel drive options available, as well as both Crew and Quad cabs, along with two different bed lengths.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Fuel Efficiency \n\nWith the eTorque system in place, you gain an extra level of efficiency and fuel economy not offered by other models. In fact, the electric assist it provides is good for about 19 miles per gallon, compared to the 17 miles per gallon of the non-eTorque V8.\n\nThe official numbers from the EPA show that the Ram 1500 can get up to 20 miles per gallon in the city, and 25 miles per gallon on the highway – this is combined with an average rating of 22 miles per gallon just with rear-wheel drive. If you compare that to last year’s model, you see the increase as the 2018 had a rating of 17 city, 25 highway, and 20 combined.\n\nIf you want to see how it stands up to the other trucks in its class, take the Chevy Silverado, for example. The 4.3 liter, V6 engine gets 18/24/20 and the Ford [F-150](https://www.autolist.com/ford-f+150) has 20/26/22.\n\n### Pricing and Value\n\nThe 2019 Dodge Ram 1500 is considered a good value for the money.\n\nThe most affordable trim, the Tradesman starts at a base price of $31,795, featuring an eight-speed automatic transmission with OD and auto manual. It’s available in 11 exterior colors and offers seating for six. Standard features include your infotainment system, passenger vanity mirror and folding mirror, dashboard storage, remote keyless entry, and class III trailering with harness, hitch.\n\nThe Big Horn/Lone Star trim starts at $36,040, with seating for five to six passengers, and 11 exterior colors to choose from. Add ons to the standard features including the trailer tow group for $400, the sport appearance package for $1,195, and the premium lighting group for $995.\n\nFor the Laramie, with a 140.5-inch wheelbase, you can expect to see prices starting at $39,940 with seating available for five to six individuals. Some of the features that come standard with this trim include an eight-way power driver seat, chrome/metal look interior accents, door mirror memory, and audio memory.\n\nThe Big Horn starts at $42,240, provides a standard 4wd configuration, and seats five to six people. With this trim, you can opt-in for the protection group at $395 or the off-road group that features an E- locker rear axle, along with a front suspension skid plate, and fuel tank skid plate.\n\nIf you want the rebel, you can expect to pay $44,240 starting and choose from six exterior colors. There is room for six in the cap, and this particular truck has a combined MPG of 22. Some of the standard features with this trim include a valet function, five USB ports, power windows, and heated front seats.\n\nThe Longhorn Crew Cab, four by two truck offers seating for five and starts at $50,640. With eight exterior colors to choose from, you can customize your truck to your particular style and taste. Standard features include heated front and back seats, leather or genuine wood steering wheel, leather dashboard and chrome interior accents.\n\nThe Limited trim is the top-of-the-line option when it comes to the 2019 Dodge Ram 1500. You can expect prices to start at $52,995 and go up from there. With seating for five, this trim offers chrome exterior accents, along with heated seats, adjustable pedals, nine USB ports and more.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Review","Truck"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/ram-ram+pickup+1500#year_min=2019\u0026year_max=2019","modified_date":"2019-05-17T17:34:24.291Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7zlJqEKKDkBVBXeJnw2kt5/3559502e88d01ba89544e733e6ebfa39/2019-hyundai-tucson-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4SnkIaHcCUj8CiZpM5wLrl/5adc1b57ebbd5036518088f2c37cb4e4/2019-hyundai-tucson-325-image.jpg","slug":"2019-hyundai-tucson-review","title":"2019 Hyundai Tucson Review","publication_date":"2019-04-23T14:49-08:00","content_summary":"The 2019 Hyundai Tucson is a leading option in the compact SUV class, offering a stylish body and a wide-array of features and add-ons.

While the 2019 model is somewhat similar to the former model, some of the newest and most noticeable features include more chrome trim, a larger grille, and smaller headlights.\n\nUnder the hood, the 1.6-liter turbo-four has been replaced by a 2.4 liter I-4, and additional safety tech is available on the Limited trim. The dash is newly organized, highlighted with a tablet-like touchscreen in the center.\n\n### Exterior\n\nThe newly designed Tucson has an appealing design, especially for those who are a fan of the styling approach used by Audi. In addition to the new body styling, this model offers fresh alloy-wheel designs. When it comes to dimensions there isn’t much of a difference; however, the chassis is designed with over 50 percent high-strength steel, which is one of the factors that is attributed to the superior safety credentials this vehicle has received.\n\nOne of the most noticeable upgrades of this vehicle is the cascading grille that is also found on a number of other Hyundai vehicles. The rear bumpers on the vehicle have also been redesigned – though subtly. You can choose either 17- or 19-inch alloy wheels, depending on which trim is used.\n\n![2019-hyundai-tucson-exterior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/mScItAUwPCNtKiC3i8n2a/0c01f60153ea21cbab7f59f588b12a02/2019-hyundai-tucson-exterior1.jpg)\n\nThe 2019 Hyundai Tucson is offered in six trim levels, including the Ultimate, Limited, Sport, SEL, Value and the base model- the SE.\n\nThe suspension on the vehicle does a good job at balancing control against a soft and compliant ride. Bums and ruts may still be felt, but they aren’t intrusive like with other vehicles in this class. Also, the quality of the ride is not too disconnected or floaty. Wind and road noise isn’t very noticeable on the highway, and it remains extremely quiet when you are cruising.\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort\n\nOne of the first things you are going to notice with the 2019 Tucson is the well-built surroundings and the tightly fitted panels, along with the European style of design. While it is somewhat monochromatic with an all-black color scheme (which comes standard), you can opt for beige upholstery, which adds a bit of contrast.\n\nCloth seating comes standard and is provided by YES Essentials. According to Hyundai, the fabric is stain resistant, repels odors, and can resist static. If you prefer leather, then you can opt for the Ultimate or Limited models, which offer this as a standard feature. You can also ramp up the luxury features further on these top trim models including a built-in air ionizer, dual-zone climate control, heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, ventilated front seats, and more.\n\n![2019-hyundai-tucson-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4AhAGMrQFivbISV8WmXktU/8a5a137825330cf6fd4459b85a8d94a3/2019-hyundai-tucson-interior2.jpg)\n\nThe interior of the Tucson has a fresh center stack, which is topped off by an all-new infotainment touch screen, along with instrument cluster, rearview mirror, panel vents, and new design for the Limited trim’s leather-covered seats.\n\nThe dash, which has been described as “sensible” houses easy-to-use, simple controls for both the audio system and climate control system. When it is dark out, the controls are backlit with a soft, blue lighting. Also, the digital display present doesn’t overload a driver, presenting too much information that may cause distraction.\n\nWhile the Tucson isn’t head of the class when it comes to spaciousness, the rear seats are still comfortable, and the luggage area has an adjustable floor, including storage for the cargo cover. If the rear seats are being used, then the cargo space offers 31 cubic feet of from, and when folded, this space almost doubles to 61.9 cubic feet.\n\nThe vehicle offers two full sets of the LATCH connectors for the installation of car seats, and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has given the LATCH system offered in the Tucson a rating of “Acceptable,” which is the second-highest available, regarding ease of use.\n\nThe interior of this vehicle looks stylish and it remains mostly quiet while traveling at average highway speeds. While this is true, the lower trims actually feature quite a bit of hard plastic, and even some of the top trims aren’t considered quite as luxurious or upscale as the rivals.\n\nIt also offers heated seats, which is included standard on all trims besides the SE. Ultimate and Limited trims also feature a heated steering wheel, and the Tucson Ultimate (specifically) has ventilated front seats, along with heated rear seats. All trims that have AWD come with a de-icing wiper system.\n\n### Utility and Practicality \n\nThis model year offers drivers a generously sized cargo space, with 31 cubic feet behind the rear seats. However, when the rear seats are folded away, this space expands to 61.9 cubic feet.\n\nThere is also plenty of storage elsewhere in this version of the 2019 Hyundai Tucson. While the smartphone charging pad is found at the bottom of a storage bin, it is a bit inconvenient if you have a lot of junk rolling around.\n\n![2019-hyundai-tucson-exterior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2L2VVKSlJkvX1zDe0Zzkvr/b986b6e71ea10e2fd89ae83138cf49ba/2019-hyundai-tucson-exterior2.jpg)\n\nAt the back of the vehicle, you receive a Smart Trunk, hands-free tailgate. This is a standard feature for the Ultimate, Limited, and Sport trims.\n\n### Technology and Infotainment\n\nWhen it comes to technology, standard features include an infotainment system, that offers a six-speaker audio system, USB ports, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, Bluetooth, and a seven-inch touch screen. Some of the available features you can opt to add-on include an eight-speaker Infinity audio system, satellite radio, navigation, an eight-inch touchscreen, wireless device charging, and a panoramic sunroof.\n\nThe features provided by the infotainment are extremely easy to use, which is attributed to the user-friendly interface, along with the convenient placement of most of the buttons and knobs. The touchscreens also work easily and are big enough to read without having to strain, which makes it a more user-friendly system in general.\n\n![2019-hyundai-tucson-interior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/H3lVtJ4cSHhdmhJlEi6Qy/757cf42bb13b416d99d1ddf5119505ad/2019-hyundai-tucson-interior1.jpg)\n\nAll the trim levels of the Tucson, besides the SE version, also include Blue Link connected services. Both the Remote and Connected care packages remain free for the first three years the vehicle is owned. What this means is that you have access to geographic boundaries, curfew, safe teen driver alerts for speed, enhanced roadside assistance, slow-down and stolen-vehicle recovery, remote access for some functions of the vehicle, automatic collision notification, and SOS emergency calling.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Safety and Driving Assistance\n\nThe NHTSA has given the 2019 Hyundai Tucson a five-star overall safety rating and this is out of a possible five stars. Some of the safety features of this particular SUV include forward collision warning, lane keeping assist, and automatic emergency braking, which are all offered standard across all trim options.\n\nStandard safety options include rear cross-traffic alert and blind-spot monitoring. These are included on all trims except the base SE grade. The Limited trim also features driver attention warning, high beam assist, pedestrian detection, and cruise control featuring stop and go function.\n\n### Driving Experience \n\nWhen it comes to the driving experience, the changes for this model have extended to the engine bay, too. The initial two trim levels, the Value, and S, include a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that provides 164 horsepower. While this gets the job done, it isn’t described as being refined.\n\nThe remainder of the range is powered by a 2.4 liter 4-cylinder engine, offering 181 horsepower. Both of these engines connect to a six-speed automatic transmission. You can choose the all-wheel-drive (AWD) with both engine options, which replaces the standard FWD (front wheel drive) setup.\n\nThe AWD Tucson models also come equipped with a “lock” feature, which enables a 50/50 torque split in between the rear and front wheels, which makes it much easier to control in wet or slippery conditions.\n\n### Fuel Efficiency\n\nThe 2019 Hyundai Tucson is available with the 2.0 liter I-4, which is standard, featuring 151 lb-ft of torque and 164 hp. If you opt for the SEL grade, or above, then the standard engine is a 2.4 liter I-4, offering 175 lb-ft and 181 hp. Across the lineup, a six-speed automatic transmission is a standard.\n\nOf the two engine options, the 2.0-liter base is the most efficient, offering an EPA fuel economy rating of 23/30 miles per gallon on the city versus highway while in front-drive guise, and 22/25 mpg when all-wheel drive is engaged. For the models with the 2.4-liter engine, you don’t get the same efficiency, with it offering 22/28 mpg for the front-drive variants, and 21/26 for those with all-wheel drive.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Pricing and Value \n\nThe compact-crossover-SUV, the 2019 Hyundai Tucson has a manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) of $23,200 along with a destination charge of $1,045, bringing it to a grand total of $24,245. For the value model, you are going to pay an additional $1,450, but moving to the SEL, you can expect to pay $26,645. The upside – this puts the larger engine at the helm.\n\nOn the more expensive end of the spectrum, you have the Limited trim, which starts at $31,345. If you pile on all the options, it’s going to be an additional $3,000 with the all-wheel-drive option costing $1,400.\n\n### The details for each trim level include:\n\n__Tucson SE 4dr SUV:__ Features a 2.0L, 4cyl engine and starts at $23,200. It seats five and gets 23 city and 30 highway miles per gallon. This comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels, a rear view camera, adjustable driver’s seat, heated mirrors, automatic headlights, and forward collision warning.\n\n__SEL 4dr SUV AWD:__ Features a 2.4L, 4cyl engine and starts at $27,000. It seats five and gets 21 city and 26 highway miles per gallon. This trim offers similar features to the Value, along with 18-inch alloy wheels, a second row USB port, dual-zone climate control, and upgraded exterior trim.\n\n__Value 4dr SUV:__ Features a 2.0L, 4cyl engine and starts at $24,650. It seats five and gets 23 city and 30 highway miles per gallon. This trim offers all the standard features of the SE, along with a power adjustable driver’s seat, roof rails, keyless access, heated front seats, push-button start, and Blue Link communications.\n\n__Sport Trim:__ This model adds LED headlights, 19-inch wheels, exterior styling enhancements, wireless smartphone charging, auto-dimming rear view mirror, a hands-free liftgate, and fog lights.\n\n__Limited Trim:__ In addition to the features mentioned above, this trim is upgraded with a power adjustable passenger seat, 360-degree parking camera system, heated steering wheel, upgraded door trim, and leather upholstery.\n\n__Ultimate Trim:__ This is the top of the trim level ladder and adds even more features to the ones mentioned above, including an upgraded eight-inch touchscreen display and navigation, heated rear seats, ventilated front seats, upgraded driver information display, adaptive cruise control, an upgraded forward collision mitigation system, automatic high beams, and a panoramic sunroof.\n\nTo compare, the [Honda CR-V](https://www.autolist.com/honda-cr+v) has a starting price of $25,250, and the price is similar for the 2019 [RAV4](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-rav4). Regarding the resale value, it’s expected that the Honda and Toyota compact SUVs are going to be the leaders, with the Hyundai falling close behind.  \n\nIt’s well-known that Hyundai, along with its sister company, Kia, offers the best of the best when it comes to competitive warranty coverage and the longest-running powertrain coverage. In fact, Hyundai is actually better than Kia in this regard, offering longer roadside-assistance terms and corrosion options. However, note that these warranties are only applicable to the initial owner of the vehicle.\n\nThe warranty options available include a limited warranty of five years or 60,000 miles – whichever comes first – along with a powertrain warranty that covers 10 years of 100,000 miles (whichever comes first).\n\nThe Tucson makes a great deal and is well-equipped, regardless of the trim you choose. It also offers you more features at a lower price than the majority of competing SUVs in this class. With this compact SUV, drivers will find the options extremely functional and versatile, allowing them to create a vehicle that meets the specific driving needs they have.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["CUV","Review"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/hyundai-tucson#year_min=2019\u0026year_max=2019","modified_date":"2019-05-17T17:34:35.479Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6IsFQXKOkSEcfYCGY9I6t5/2d751aaa827bce5b2258d3f8943030ab/2019-jeep-wrangler-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/526k64CuWhZq9Wf4uvEgsI/babb1e60dfbd2893f54badeb47ba083f/2019-jeep-wrangler-325-image_.jpg","slug":"2019-jeep-wrangler-review","title":"2019 Jeep Wrangler Review","publication_date":"2019-04-22T08:53-08:00","content_summary":"The Jeep Wrangler's looks are a blast from the past, but it's packed with the latest in off-road, comfort, and performance technologies.","parent_page":{"name":"Jeep Wrangler","description":"Jeep Wrangler MM page","slug":"jeep-wrangler"},"categories":[{"name":"Car Review","description":"Autolist Car Review","parentCategory":{"name":"Reviews","description":"Reviews"}}],"category":{"name":"Car Review","description":"Autolist Car Review","parentCategory":{"name":"Reviews","description":"Reviews"}},"author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"body":"### Summary\n\nThe 2019 Jeep Wrangler is an off-road capable SUV that competes with vehicles like the [Toyota 4Runner](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-4runner), though it has very few direct competitors. Because of its very focused off-roading orientation, there are not many other new vehicles that offer a comparable feature set, though the upcoming [Ford Bronco](https://www.autolist.com/ford-bronco) will be close. The Wrangler was redesigned for the 2018 model year and has light updates for 2019 that include new safety features and new paint colors.\n\nThe Wrangler has been produced by various brands over the years, eventually landing with Jeep in the late 1980s. Even though it is a modern vehicle with some of the latest technologies, the Wrangler’s purpose and appearance today are nearly the same as they were when the vehicle was first produced several decades ago. Like the vehicles before it, the Wrangler continues to use body-on-frame construction, rigid live axles, and removable doors. The new Wrangler, also known as the JL Wrangler, takes those rugged features and adds modern electronically-controlled suspension and four-wheel drive components to make the on- and off-road experience as convenient as possible.\n\nThe Jeep Wrangler is aimed at active new car buyers who plan to take the vehicle on trails and off-road. As such, many versions of the Wrangler are equipped with features like skid plates, heavy duty suspensions, and four-wheel drive. These options give the Wrangler unmatched abilities with greater approach and departure angles than other vehicles on sale. These angles are the maximum angle of a ramp or obstacle that the vehicle can drive on without scraping body panels. The Wrangler also has an optional feature that can electronically disconnect sway bars, which allows the suspension to move much more freely, also increasing the vehicle's climbing and descent abilities.\n\nThe 2019 Wrangler is available in four trims: Sport, Sport S, Sahara, and Rubicon. Two- and four-door configurations are available, and Sahara trim is only offered with four doors.  Various special editions become available at times, including the Moab limited edition, which has blacked-out wheels and trim pieces and groups other popular options together, such as an Alpine stereo system, upgraded infotainment unit, and premium interior upholstery.\n\nThe four-door Wrangler Unlimited configuration was introduced over ten years ago to improve the Wrangler’s appeal for buyers needing more space. The configuration became so popular, that by 2017 nearly three quarters of all new Wranglers on sale were Unlimited models.\n\n### Exterior\n\nThe Jeep Wrangler is unique in the automotive world, because its basic appearance hasn’t changed much over the vehicle’s storied history. \n\n![2019-jeep-wrangler-exterior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5yB60MBUNcp3SjNAH9g1uT/0ed7f657b6414ce6fda028b53e3e7de8/2019-jeep-wrangler-exterior1.jpg)\n\nThe Wrangler’s complete overhaul in 2018 brought modern updates to the classic design, and included available LED lighting, an all-new front fascia, optional winch-ready bumpers with removable end caps, larger windows, and improved aerodynamics. One thing that has remained the same is the Wrangler’s ability to have its top, doors, and windshield removed, which are standout features in the market today.\n\nExterior changes for the 2019 model year are less substantial, amounting to a new paint color.\n\nDespite the Wrangler’s traditional looks, critics have praised the recently updated vehicle for its supremely functional appearance and versatile top configurations. The new Wrangler is available with a variety of wheel sizes, ranging from 17 inches to 19 inches, multiple paint and body configurations, soft and hard tops, and can be customized with lighting and off-road specialty kits. Jeep also builds the Wrangler to be very flexible from the factory, with the ability to add bigger wheels, lighting kits, winches, and various other off-road recreation items.\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort\n\nLike the rest of the Wrangler, the interior was significantly updated for the 2018 model year. The center console was redesigned, seats were updated with adjustable bolsters and lumbar supports, and available comfort features like a heated steering wheel were added.\n\n![2019-jeep-wrangler-interior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2fyJVc61wZYywHFxoiOa83/966af1f24efbbadfa6ef600e30812664/2019-jeep-wrangler-interior1.jpg)\n\nAs a rugged off-roader, the Wrangler can be ordered as a barebones vehicle, only offering the essentials for daily use. On the other end of the spectrum, Jeep offers the Wrangler as a four-door SUV with several options that increase comfort and convenience like leather seating, upgraded sound systems and infotainment, and a variety of hard and soft top choices.\n\nCritics have given the new seats high marks for their comfort and support but note that adjustments are difficult to make on the move. The Wrangler comes standard with cloth upholstery, which can be upgraded to a Premium cloth. Reviewers have noted both versions to be comfortable but rugged and stain resistant, which is important when taking the vehicle off the pavement.\n\nThe Wrangler’s near-vertical dash is low enough for great outward visibility and the seating position provides good side visibility. Reviewers take away points for rear visibility, however, with many noting that the thick roof pillars, roll bars, and other equipment can obstruct viewing angles.\n\nRear seating accommodations are roomy and benefit from a more reclined seatback. The two-door Wrangler’s boxy shape and folding front seats may make back seat entry and exit difficult for taller adults or people with limited mobility. Four-door Wranglers have much easier access to the rear seats and more room in the second row as well. Many reviewers recommend the larger Unlimited Wrangler for buyers that need to carry children, because of its much easier access to loading and unloading car seats.\n\n### Utility and Practicality\n\nWith the rear seats upright, the Wrangler’s cargo volume is 31.7 cubic feet, which falls short of the [Toyota 4Runner](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-4runner)’s 47.2 inches. When the seats are folded, cargo room opens up to 72.4 inches, which reviewers note as being generous for a vehicle of the Wrangler’s size. Access to the rear storage area is hindered by a two-step process that involves moving the rear windshield and opening the gate, which some reviewers mention as being difficult when carrying bags or children.\n\n![2019-jeep-wrangler-exterior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4l5DFt3fkCcdZ6pdjRDRDs/e87e47704f951710a507caa394a83648/2019-jeep-wrangler-exterior2.jpg)\n\nThere are under-floor storage spaces and small-item storage in the cabin that make daily driving with the Wrangler more convenient. The Wrangler also has front and rear compartment storage trays and cargo tie-down loops.\n\nCritics note that the Wrangler’s overall utility and usability are impacted by its increased ride height and off-road focus. Loading cargo into the rear area is made more difficult by the fact that the Wrangler is taller than other SUVs in its class. Two-door versions will be difficult for families with small children, as both the height and smaller back seat area hinder entry and exit.\n\nThe open-air experience that the Wrangler offers comes with tradeoffs in the form of increased road and engine noise inside the cabin. Hard top versions do a much better job of filtering out excessive noise from outside, but Wranglers with a soft top let quite a bit of sound filter through.\n\nThe Wrangler can tow up to 3,500 pounds, which is good enough for most small recreation vehicles and boats.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Technology and Infotainment\n\nThe Wrangler comes standard with a five-inch display that can be upgraded to a seven-inch display or an 8.4-inch display with navigation. All versions of the infotainment unit come with Fiat Chrysler America’s Uconnect infotainment system, which reviewers have praised as being smooth, colorful, and easy to use.\n\n![2019-jeep-wrangler-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/Ue0TtucM4hJYuGRoh8Ng3/eefe0f46648465bc3e4b6cd0f88007c7/2019-jeep-wrangler-interior2.jpg)\n\nThe Uconnect system uses on-screen controls and configurable icons that allow for flexibility in what is displayed on the screen. The standard five-inch screen comes with integrated voice commands, Bluetooth phone and audio connections, and available SiriusXM. This smaller screen has an older version of Uconnect than larger screens.  \n\nThe seven- and 8.4-inch screens feature Uconnect 4, which brings Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The larger screen also has navigation, SiriusXM Traffic, and SiriusXM Travel Link.\nAll Wranglers come standard with eight-speaker audio, 12-volt power outlets, and USB inputs. An Alpine nine-speaker system is optional that includes an all-weather subwoofer and a 552-watt amplifier. \n\nWithin the Uconnect infotainment unit, Jeep has added a special and optional Off-Road Pages function. This shows real time information on the status of the transfer case, ride height, pitch of the vehicle, and the currently selected drive mode.\n\n### Safety and Driving Assistance\n\nAll 2019 Wranglers come with advanced multistage airbags, a backup camera with gridlines, electronic stability control, and hill-start assist. Advanced safety features are optional and are sold in groups: The Active Safety Group includes rear park assist, blind-spot monitoring, and LED tail lamps. The Advanced Safety Group has adaptive cruise control and forward collision warnings. Both options groups are available for all but the base Sport trim Wrangler.\n\nThe 2019 Wrangler hasn’t been rated by either of the main testing agencies in the United States, the NHTSA or IIHS. The new Wrangler has been tested by Europe’s testing agency, NCAP, which gave it good scores in side impact testing and for whiplash testing. The agency noted that the Wrangler provided marginal protection for the chest, neck and body areas for the driver and adult passengers during front-impact crash-testing.\n\n### Driving Experience\n\nThe Wrangler is one of the most capable off-road vehicles you can buy today. Tall ride height, coupled with standard skid plates and an optional limited-slip differential, give the Wrangler unmatched abilities. Sahara models are available with an automatic four-wheel drive system that functions like all-wheel drive, kicking in when traction is lost. Critics praise this system for its convenience and ease of use over a traditional four-wheel drive system that has to be shifted on and off when needed.\n\nRecent updates to the Wrangler have made it more refined on-road and more capable off-road. Reviewers agree that the latest version of the Wrangler is more compliant and easier to drive than ever before but find that the ride is still choppier and more truck-like than competitors.\n\nThe Wrangler comes standard with a 3.6-liter V6 engine that has 285 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque. Reviewers note that the base engine has no trouble with acceleration and getting up to highway speeds. The optional engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that has 270 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque. This engine is praised for its lively acceleration and improved fuel economy. \n\nThe base Wrangler Sport trim comes standard with a six-speed manual transmission and can be upgraded to an eight speed automatic transmission. All other Wrangler trims come standard with an eight-speed automatic.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Fuel Efficiency\n\nThe 2019 Jeep Wrangler is considered to have average fuel economy. Two-door Wranglers with the 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine have EPA-estimated fuel economy ratings of 23/25/24 MPG city/highway/combined that change to 22/24/22 MPG when equipped with four doors.\n\nWhen equipped with the 3.6-liter V6 and manual transmission, the two-door Wrangler’s fuel economy ratings are 17/25/20 MPG city/highway/combined. Four-door models are rated at 17/23/19 MPG. With an automatic transmission, those numbers change to 18/23/20 for both models.\n\nThe four-cylinder engine helps the Wrangler best rivals like the Toyota 4Runner, which achieves its best fuel economy ratings in two-wheel drive-only configuration at 17/21/18 MPG city/highway/combined.\n\n### Pricing and Value\n\nThe Wrangler, in its most basic forms, is considered by many critics to be too stripped-down for many buyers. At under $30,000, the Wrangler Sport lacks many features that buyers expect as standard, like power windows and door locks. The most recommended trim level from reviewers is the Sport S, which adds in creature comforts like air conditioning and includes power windows and door locks that may be a deal breaker for many buyers.\n\nThe Wrangler Sport starts at $29,540 including a $1,495 destination fee and includes a six-speed manual transmission, manual windows and door locks, halogen headlights, fog lights, skid plates, 17-inch wheels with all-season tires, a folding soft top, LED interior lighting, push-button start, cloth upholstery, manual seat adjustments, and rear heating ducts.\n\nThe Wrangler Sport S has an MSRP that starts at $32,740 with destination and has power windows and door locks, high-gloss 17-inch wheels, air conditioning, and remote keyless entry. Four-wheel drive is standard. Upgrading to the four-door Unlimited model adds $3,500.\n\nThe Wrangler Sahara has an MSRP that starts at $39,890 after destination and includes special Sahara badging, automatic headlights, 18-inch wheels with all-terrain tires, dual-zone climate controls, LED footwell lighting, premium cloth seating surfaces, a universal garage door opener, a 115-volt power outlet in the center console, and a rear-seat USB port. The Wrangler Sahara is only available in the four-door Unlimited configuration.\n\nThe Wrangler Rubicon has an MSRP that starts at $39,540 and has a heavy-duty Dana solid front axle, electronically-locking differentials, an electronically-controlled sway bar disconnect, a Rock-Trac shift-on-the-fly transfer case, special Rubicon badging, black painted rock rails, and 17-inch all-terrain tires.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Review","Jeep Wrangler"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/jeep-wrangler#year_min=2019\u0026year_max=2019","modified_date":"2019-05-17T17:34:35.533Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6GJuWoAHjjwpj79c2b5OrM/bff37d7e814ebe394a7de62e8c49e7d5/2019-jeep-cherokee-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4Xee5nhd4tqm7SReA1gn0V/f97f36e06935a058e0b916d0e93f8204/2019-jeep-cherokee-325-image.jpg","slug":"2019-jeep-cherokee-review","title":"2019 Jeep Cherokee Review","publication_date":"2019-04-19T10:30-08:00","content_summary":"The 2019 Jeep Cherokee is a compact crossover SUV.

Small improvements over the years, both mechanically and stylistically, have made it a well-rounded choice for those who want to work during the day and play in the great outdoors at night and on the weekends.  \n\n### Exterior \n\nFCA made the 2019 Jeep Cherokee a more normal-looking crossover SUV thanks to its new facelift. It is more conservative and follows Jeep’s design language more closely, mimicking its [Jeep Compass](https://www.autolist.com/jeep-compass) and [Grand Cherokee](https://www.autolist.com/jeep-grand+cherokee) siblings.  \n\n![2019-jeep-cherokee-exterior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6KDBTQqa1RMxk1hTXh7szr/3991d7ae1380f4a1187ad1a2da0ae2fd/2019-jeep-cherokee-exterior1.jpg)\n\nIt’s more aggressive capabilities still show through its softened exterior with 7.7 inches of ground clearance in non-Trailhawk models. The Trailhawk trim adds a whole inch of ground clearance with additional badging, red tow hooks in front, and more aggressive tires for a serious appearance.  \n\nUnique exterior trim is also present on the Trailhawk and Overland trims for a distinct appearance.  \n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort\n\nInterior quality has notably been improved for the 2019 Cherokee refresh.  \n\nOverall impressions from reviewers can be summed up in the word, “serviceable.” Though quality has been improved, materials and comfort are still average for the class.  \n\n![2019-jeep-cherokee-interior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5dICNTcbvXMB6alNZsIgGk/f37a2bb53307b5c7edd605bb70ae9061/2019-jeep-cherokee-interior1.jpg)\n\nHigher trim levels do offer leather seating, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and upholstery for an upgraded feel, but plastic parts are present throughout the interior.  \n\nHeadroom and legroom are both plentiful with an easy step-in height. Some reviewers noted that the lower roof overhang was slightly inconvenient when entering the rear seats. Seats were noted to be comfortable while not overly supportive.  \n\nRide comfort and road noise are both reported to be average and expected for an SUV.  \n\n### Utility \u0026 Practicality\n\nThough the Cherokee’s cargo space increased for 2019, it still falls far short of the competition. With 24.7 cubic feet of cargo space, it falls behind almost all other competitors in the segment.  \n\n![2019-jeep-cherokee-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5ytqldnKk8a8qi1hkNzorz/3b7fd809b0932abe5758d527bb75c1c5/2019-jeep-cherokee-interior2.jpg)\n\nDespite the lack of cargo space in the trunk, storage cubbies are plentiful throughout the cabin, and an adjustable cargo load floor makes trunk space more efficient. Both the rear seats can be folded down for longer or larger items.  \n\nIn contrast to the Cherokee’s lack of cargo area, its towing capacity is best in class. Cherokees equipped with the 271 horsepower V6 engine can tow up to 4500 pounds while the new 2.0 liter turbocharged four cylinder engine can handle up to 4000 pounds.  \n\nOne of Jeep’s best known attributes is that it can go anywhere. One tester noted that he tested the Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk alongside the Jeep Wrangler Rubicon, and it was able to do just about everything the Rubicon did, which is impressive.  \n\nIt should be noted that the Cherokee’s approach and departure angle grant it slightly less utility than the Wrangler for serious off-roaders.  \n\n![2019-jeep-cherokee-exterior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/72LWZVf7ou99ytvkpizxFg/987ca1c1308d9cd1f9db13b104dcc730/2019-jeep-cherokee-exterior2.jpg)\n\nThough its off-road and towing capabilities make it one of the most well-rounded SUVs in its class, its comparative lack of cargo space brings its overall practicality and utility down to about average for the segment.  \n\n### Technology \u0026 Infotainment\n\nTechnology and infotainment features are well-represented in the 2019 Jeep Cherokee.  \n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard across all trims of the Cherokee. While the Uconnect touchscreen infotainment system was upgraded for 2019, the standard screen size is only 7 inches in diameter, small compared to other competitors.  \n\nTesters commented that the infotainment system was one of the best and easiest to use as the layout was very simple and easy to understand. Many also commented that the icons and display lettering was small and hard to read.  \n\nAn upgraded 8.4 inch touchscreen infotainment system is optional on higher trim levels.  \n\nStandard technology equipment offerings are strong with automatic HID headlights, heated mirrors, Bluetooth, and a rearview camera.  \n\nOptional technology features include an automated liftgate, a parking assist system, remote start, and Jeep’s more advanced Active Drive II 4WD system.  \n\n### Safety \u0026 Driving Assistance\n\nSafety and driving assistance features are available for Cherokee buyers, but unfortunately, many of those are only available on higher trim levels.  \n\nStandard features include a backup camera, traction control, and a rearview camera that can be turned on even when the vehicle isn’t in reverse.  \n\nOptional safety features have been increased for 2019 and are quite competitive for the segment. They include blind spot monitoring, forward collision alert, automatic emergency braking, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, automatic high-beam headlights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and even active parking assist.  \n\nThe 2018 Cherokee earned a “marginal” score in the small overlap crash test for the driver’s side while it earned top marks for child safety. The 2019 Cherokee has not been crash tested yet but is expected to be with reported improvements from Fiat-Chrysler, making it safer.  \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Driving Experience\n\nReviewers of the Cherokee were pleasantly surprised by its overall improvements, especially the new turbocharged four cylinder engine.  \n\nJeep offers three engine options for the Cherokee, all of which are paired to a 9-speed automatic transmission:  \n\n1. The naturally-aspirated, 2.4 liter, four cylinder engine produces 180 horsepower and 171 lb-ft. of torque.  \n\n2. The turbocharged, 2.0 liter, four cylinder engine produces 270 horsepower and 295 lb-ft. of torque.  \n\n3. The naturally-aspirated, 3.3 liter, V6 engine produces 271 horsepower and 239 lb-ft. of torque.  \n\nTesters are surprised, though not overwhelmed, by the Cherokee’s handling capability. It weighs about 4000 pounds, which is more than most of its competitors.  \n\nWhen mated with the turbo four cylinder or V6 engine, it is noted that handling is surprisingly nimble, though acceleration is slightly underwhelming due to its weight and transmission.  \n\nReviewers of the Cherokee almost universally cite its nine-speed automatic transmission as a downfall to the SUV. It is noted to be sluggish, poor to upshift and downshift at times, and finicky.  \n\nIt should also be noted that reviewers also found the transmission to be slightly improved for 2019, adding that the additional power of the V6 and the 2.0 liter turbo engines help mitigate the feel of any transmission sluggishness.  \n\nAlmost all reviewers agreed that the 2.4 liter four cylinder base engine option was slow to respond, not adequate for the weight of the Cherokee, and should be avoided in favor of one of the other two engine options.  \n\nBraking was noted to be better than average in both feel and actual testing. Braking results show better than average stopping distance for the segment, a highlight for how much the SUV weighs.  \n\n### Fuel efficiency\n\nThe Cherokee's fuel economy lags behind the competition.  \n\nThe base 2.4 liter engine gets an EPA estimated 22 miles per gallon in the city and 31 miles per gallon on the highway with front wheel drive. Adding all wheel drive drops those numbers to 21 miles per gallon in the city and 29 on the highway.  \n\nThe 2.0 liter, turbocharged engine gets an EPA estimated 23 miles per gallon in city driving and 31 in highway driving with front wheel drive. Adding all wheel drive provides two less miles per gallon in both the city and on the highway.  \n\nThe 3.2 liter V6 delivers an EPA estimated 20 miles per gallon in the city and 29 on the highway with front wheel drive. With all wheel drive, you can expect 19 miles per gallon in the city and 27 on the highway.  \n\nThe Active Drive II Four-Wheel Drive system decreases fuel economy further. When equipped with the 2.0 liter turbocharged engine, EPA estimates fall to 20 and 27 miles per gallon in the city and highway respectively. The V6 falls to 18 and 26 miles per gallon in the city and highway respectively.  \n\n### Pricing \u0026 Value\n\nThe Jeep Cherokee provides varied levels of value.  \n\nIf interior space, upscale interior, and a great driving experience are important to you, the Cherokee will fall behind competitors such as the Mazda CX-5, Honda CR-V, and Toyota RAV4.  \n\nIf you are the adventurous type, consistently haul trailers, or feel like going anywhere at any time, the Jeep Cherokee provides excellent value and tremendous off-road capability.  \n\nThe Cherokee’s base price is higher than most other competitors, but its capability far exceeds most in the segment.  \n\nAnother area of value the Cherokee provides is the ability to choose several features instead of choosing entire package options for different trim levels. Jeep does offer several packages to add to the Cherokee, but not all are necessary for certain individual features to be added to your trim of choice.  \n\nAll trim levels of the Cherokee are available with all wheel drive with it being standard on the Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk. Adding all wheel drive to any of these trim levels will raise the price by $500.  \n\nAll trim levels, except the base Latitude, receive the 2.4 liter four cylinder engine as standard but can be optioned with either the 2.0 liter turbocharged engine or V6 engine. The 2.4 liter engine is the only engine option available on the base Latitude.  \n\nTrim levels able to be fitted with all wheel drive are also able to be upgraded to the Active Drive Four-Wheel Drive system standard on the Trailhawk trim.  \n\nA tow package is available for Latitude Plus, Limited, and Trailhawk trims. It includes a Class III hitch, transmission cooler, and trailer wiring. Cherokees with the V6 engine and tow package coupled include a more robust engine cooling system as well.  \n\nA technology package with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, and forward collision warning can also be equipped to Limited, Trailhawk, and Overland trims.  \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### The Cherokee is available in five different trim options:  \n\n__Jeep Cherokee Latitude__\n\nThe Latitude is the base model Cherokee and starts at just over $26,000 with destination fee included.  \n\nStandard equipment on the Latitude includes the 2.4 liter engine, front wheel drive, air conditioning, 17-inch alloy wheels, a rearview camera, a six speaker audio system, automatic headlights, and a 60/40 split rear seat. A 7-inch touchscreen Uconnect infotainment system is also standard on the base Latitude.  \n\n__Jeep Cherokee Latitude Plus__ \n\nOpting for the Latitude Plus will push the price to $28,000 with destination and the base 2.4 liter engine equipped with front wheel drive.  \n\nThe Latitude Plus adds some luxury features to the base model such as push button start, leather upholstery, a power driver’s seat, and satellite radio.  \n\nJeep also offers the Comfort and Convenient Package for the Latitude Plus trim. This package includes remote start, dual-zone climate control, a regular household electrical outlet, a power liftgae, and programmable garage door opener.  \n\n__Jeep Cherokee Limited__\n\nThe Jeep Cherokee Limited starts at around $32,000 with destination and the base 2.4 liter engine as well as front wheel drive.  \n\nThe Limited trim is essentially a Jeep Cherokee Latitude Plus with the Comfort and Convenience Package included and the addition of several luxury and safety features.  \n\nIt includes heated front seats, a power passenger seat, the upgraded 8.4 inch Uconnect touchscreen infotainment system, and a driver information system integrated into the gauge cluster.  \n\nSafety features include blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, and parking sensors.  \n\n__Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk__  \n\nThe Cherokee Trailhawk starts at about $35,500 with destination.  \n\nIt comes standard with the 271 horsepower V6 engine and Active Drive Four-Wheel Drive system which is a more advanced system than Jeep’s regular all wheel drive system. Included in this system is Active Drive Lock and Jeep’s selec-terrain management system for various driving conditions.  \n\nThe Trailhawk is equipped with most of the Limited trim option except for the power liftgate. Additionally, it is equipped with skid plates, larger and wider wheels and all-terrain tires, unique exterior trail rated badging and trim coloration, a cloth-leather combination interior, Jeep’s hill management system a locking rear differential, and a more robust suspension system which adds 1 inch of ground clearance.  \n\nA navigation system is an optional extra.  \n\nFully optioned, a Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk Elite will exceed $45,000 and is the most well suited trim level for serious off-roading.  \n\n__Jeep Cherokee Overland__\n\nThe Cherokee Overland tops out the Cherokee line and starts at just over $38,000 with destination. It is equipped with the V6 engine and front wheel drive as standard.  \n\nA nine-speaker audio system, navigation system, sunroof, 18-inch alloy wheels, upgraded leather seats, upholstery, and center console, driver memory seats, power passenger seating, and ventilated front seats are all features available on the Overland trim.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["SUV","Review"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/jeep-cherokee#year_min=2019\u0026year_max=2019","modified_date":"2019-05-17T17:34:22.551Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7gT64kikFzcZJkamowP2lI/c83e090cd0ae2d42182dd269b5938f50/2019-ford-mustang-1166-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5QgPRbAFe5Odvrw47oX42K/0c327da69ee3e18c4a62554417ba8020/2019-ford-mustang-325-image.jpg","slug":"2019-ford-mustang-review","title":"2019 Ford Mustang Review","publication_date":"2019-04-18T09:56+03:00","content_summary":"The 2019 Ford Mustang is latest version of the iconic American Muscle Car which originally debuted back in 1964.

Known as a pony car, the Mustang is an American made muscle car popular around the world. \n\nIn 2018, Ford reported selling 125,809 Mustang coupes and convertibles in 146 countries across 2017. The company called the Mustang the world’s best selling sports coupe for three years in a row.\n\nThe highlights of the new 2019 Ford Mustang are the release of a long awaited Bullitt inspired trim, new California Special customization package, and continued performance upgrades to the Mustang Shelby GT trims. \n\n### Exterior\n\nThe Ford Mustang is a legendary American made muscle car. \n\n![2019-ford-mustang-exterior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2IxGTQMml8YE0hLzd4hPrV/f13d28f6b3f79ea9c1ac60383357bc4f/2019-ford-mustang-exterior1.jpg)\n\nWith nearly endless customization options and an athletic exterior design, the 2019 Mustang features some unique trims such as the Ford Mustang Bullitt and Ford Mustang Shelby GT350 which offer an impressive mix of style and performance. \n\nThe 2019 Mustang is available in the following colors:\n\n- B5    Dark Highland Green*\n- AJ    Need For Green*\n- E7    Velocity Blue*\n- G1    Shadow Black\n- J7    Magnetic Metallic\n- L6    Kona Blue\n- NL    Orange Fury\n- PQ    Race Red\n- RR    Ruby Red Tint\n- UX    Ingot Silver\n- YZ    Oxford White\n\n** new for 2019*\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort\n\nWhile most 2019 Ford Mustangs can seat up to four people, race inspired versions such as the Shelby GT350 are only designed for a driver and passenger. \n\n![2019-ford-mustang-interior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/55A2VMJN7whLhEFycQba4M/02cdc6c2a457e3b55783591d78635efd/2019-ford-mustang-interior1.jpg)\n\nMost reviewers found the front seats of the Mustang to be quite comfortable though those seated in the back may feel a bit tight and cramped.\n\nBoth rear seats feature two sets of LATCH car-seat connectors. Some reviewers found these connectors a bit difficult to use when compared to other cars. Additionally, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Mustang a lower than average rating of marginal for the LATCH system's ease of use. \n\n### Utility \u0026 Practicality\n\nWith a two door design, limited backseat space and a sporty, performance oriented design, the Ford Mustang might not be as practical as sedans or SUVs but is very functional for a muscle car. \n\nThe Ford Mustang features one of the largest cargo capacities of a muscle car at 13.5 cubic feet. This is enough storage space to comfortably fit a large number of shopping bags or up to two sets of golf clubs. \n\nWith the addition of a more fuel efficient Ecoboost trim, the 2019 Ford Mustang is one of the more practical muscle cars to use as a daily driver. \n\n### Technology \u0026 Infotainment\n\n2019 Mustang includes a SYNC infotainment system with 4.2-inch infotainment display, six speaker audio system, rearview camera, proximity key with push button start. Reviewers found the Mustang to include a good combination of modern technologies and classic designs which remain true to the history of this car. \n\n![2019-ford-mustang-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5ISxWpYM8iRUnaIHMsO9AJ/8b925642c266626c7e144e7c3cbffeb4/2019-ford-mustang-interior2.jpg)\n\nThe Mustang can be upgraded to include a SYNC 3 infotainment system, 8-inch touch screen, nine speaker audio system, satellite radio, Wi-Fi hotspot, dual-zone climate control ambient lighting, pony projection lamps, voice activated navigation system and a Shaker 12 speaker audio system. \n\n### Safety \u0026 Driving Assistance\n\nThe Ford Mustang earned a perfect five star rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This rating includes an overall, frontal crash, side crash and rollover test. \n\n- The Mustang is equipped with the following safety features: \n- Driver Air Bag\n- Passenger Air Bag\n- Front Head Air Bag\n- Rear Head Air Bag\n- Front Side Air Bag\n- 4-Wheel ABS\n- 4-Wheel Disc Brakes\n- Brake Assist\n- Electronic Stability Control\n- Traction Control\n- Lane Departure Warning\n\n### Driving Experience\n\nThe Ford Mustang wins praise from reviewers for the wealth of options available across the car’s various trim levels. Known for good reason as a muscle car, the 2019 Mustang offers everything from the more fuel efficient, 2.3-liter Ecoboost four-cylinder engine up to the 5.2 liter V8 engine in the Shelby GT350. \n\nMost reviewers found the Mustang to be a fun and lively car to drive, whether across town to pick up groceries or out on the track in an ultra high performance setting. \n\nA rear wheel drive sports car, upper level trims of the Mustang feature the following driving modes: Normal, Sport+, Track, Drag Strip, and Snow/Wet. \n\nReviewers found this car to handle well without being overly challenging to manuever making it a good choice for everyday use.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Fuel efficiency\n\nThe 2019 Ford Mustang Ecoboost trims come with a 2.3-liter Ecoboost four cylinder engine. Reviewers cited this trim level as an adequate compromise between the high performance race track variants and a more fuel efficient car for everyday commutes and drives around town. \n\n![2019-ford-mustang-exterior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/vsHaVKuHB9AdpxUbFl3Ge/b820c49980d5c5915cdabbe7481af738/2019-ford-mustang-exterior2.jpg)\n\nWhile still able to deliver 310 horsepower, the fuel economy rating of 21 miles per gallon in the city and 32 miles per gallon on the highway are more efficient than many other muscle cars. \n\nThe Mustang GT will get about 16 miles per gallon in the city and 25 miles per gallon on the highway.The 5.2-liter V8 driving the Shelby GT350 and GT350R offers 526 horsepower. \n\n### Pricing and Value \n\nThe 2019 Ford Mustang begins at about $25,845. Choosing to upgrade to a Mustang GT could bring that price up to $40,000 or more depending on how the vehicle is customized.\n\nWhile that is much less expensive than competitors such as the [Dodge Challenger](https://www.autolist.com/dodge-challenger) Hellcat and [Chevrolet Camaro ZL1](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-camaro-zl1), it is far more than cars like the [Mazda MX-5 Miata](https://www.autolist.com/mazda-mx+5+miata) and [Toyota 86](https://www.autolist.com/scion-fr+s).\n\nThe Mustang is available in 7 different trim levels with many different options available for customization. As the most popular sports car in America in 2018 according to national sales numbers, many reviewers found this car to be a great value for those interested in an American made muscle car. \n\nThe Mustang is protected with a three-year/36,000-mile basic warranty and a five-year/60,000-mile powertrain warranty. J.D. Power and Associates awarded the Mustang a predicted reliability rating of three out of five, which is an average score for reliability and longevity. \n\nFord offers a variety of pricing incentives targeted towards though who have served in the United States military, first responders, students and recent graduates as well as for those with disabilities who might require special adaptations to their vehicles. \n\nEach of these special pricing incentives with the exception of the discount for those with disabilities is worth $500 off the leasing or purchase of a new 2019 Ford Mustang. \n\nThose with disabilities may be able to qualify for up to a $1,000 reimbursement for the installation of adaptive technologies. \n\n__Ford Mustang EcoBoost__\n\nThe 2019 Ford Mustang EcoBoost is available as a hardtop fastback for $25,845 or convertible for $31,345. It has a 2.3-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder engine and six-speed manual transmission standard; a 10-speed automatic transmission is optional. This car’s standard features include: a SYNC infotainment system, 4.2 inch display, two USB ports, six speakers, a rearview camera, push-button start, proximity key, manual adjustable seats with cloth upholstery throughout the interior. \n\n__Ford Mustang EcoBoost Premium__\n\nThe Ford Mustang Ecoboost Premium starts at $30,860 as a hard top, fastback. A convertible option is available for an additional $5,500. The premium trim includes an upgraded SYNC 3 infotainment system, 8 inch touch screen, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, nine speaker audio system, and satellite radio system. It also features leather trimmed seats with heat, ventilation and power adjustment settings in the front. This trim level also features rear parking sensors, dual-zone automatic climate control, aluminum foot pedals, ambient lighting, and pony projection lamps. This last feature allows an adjustable light to shine a mustang logo on the ground near the car. \n\n__Ford Mustang GT__\n\nStarting at $35,355 for a GT Fastback, $39,366 for a GT Premium Fastback, or $44,855 for a GT Premium Convertible, the 5.0-liter V8 engine is the main upgrade of this trim level. This trim includes a standard six-speed transmission with rev matching with the option of switching to a 10 speed manual transmission. Standard features of the GT trims include dual exhaust with quad tips, a limited slip rear axle, six way power adjusted front seats and rear parking sensors. This trim can be upgraded to the California Special package for an additional $2,000. This upgrade includes unique badges, style details as well as 19-inch wheels, a pedestal style rear spoiler, suede interior and a modified front grille. \n\n__Ford Mustang Bullitt__\n\nDesigned to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Steve McQueen’s iconic role as Frank Bullitt in the 1968 movie “Bullitt”, this trim level is based around the GT Fastback. This trim level features  a more powerful V8 engine, less exterior branding badging, an improved suspension, leather trimmed seats with dark green accents and a 12 inch all digital instrument cluster. It is only available in green paint to match the version seen on screen in the movie. The Ford Mustang Bullitt is available for an MSRP of about $59,500. \n\n__Ford Mustang Shelby GT350__\n\nThe Ford Mustang GT350 is available for an MSRP of about $60,235. This race track inspired trim features a 526-horsepower 5.2-liter V8 engine. New in the 2019 model year, the GT350 features performance improvements such as changes to the body shape to improve aerodynamics and a new spoiler offering better grip at high speeds.

The 2019 Ford Explorer is part of the truck’s fifth generation originally released in 2011. In 2016, the Explorer received its last notable updates with renewed exterior styling, a larger turbo-charged four cylinder engine, updated audio and climate control settings and a hand’s free liftgate.  In January of 2019, Ford announced the Explorer’s sixth generation which is set to be released in 2020.\n\nThis model year’s Ford Explorer does not have any major new additions or features. Many reviewers cited the ever expanding mid-size SUV market the Explorer competes in to be extremely challenging. \n\nCompetitors such as the [Honda Pilot](https://www.autolist.com/honda-pilot), [Toyota Highlander](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-highlander), [Chevrolet Traverse](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-traverse) and [Audi Q7](https://www.autolist.com/audi-q7) among others each offer value, performance and comfort advances which often place the Explorer in the bottom third of SUVs reviewed. The Ford Explorer’s three engine options and on-board technology stand out. Some reviewers felt lack of legroom, fuel economy and handling concerns in certain trims to be issues worth considering before a new car purchase . \n\n### Exterior\n\nThe Ford Explorer is one of the most recognizable mid-size SUVs on the market today. The base frame and shape of the Explorer remains largely unchanged since 2011. Some reviewers cite the 2019 Ford Explorer’s lack of exterior updating as a setback which makes it harder for this truck to compete against competitors which have been re-styled more recently. \n\n![2019-ford-explorer-exterior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/40D1Krs758iwTEB4RtbAZL/3f391909391a9698453ee152f5da78c1/2019-ford-explorer-exterior1.jpg)\n\nOn the outside, the Ford Explorer’s body shape is clean and recognizable with very little adornment or excessive branding elements. Some reviewers highlight that the Explorer looks best with lighter shades of colors combined with larger wheels. Alloy wheels and tinted windows are standard features on all current Ford Explorers.\n\nThe Explorer Sport trim comes with a black front grille which makes it look very similar to the law enforcement vehicle, the Ford Interceptor. The Explorer Platinum is matched with LED lights and unique wheels which help it to look more luxurious than other models. \n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Interior Quality and Comfort\n\nReviewers found some high and low points when it comes to the Ford Explorer’s interior quality and comfort. Lower level trims of this truck, as might be expected, are unable to match the higher quality look and feel of the upper level trims. \n\nThough there is plenty of seating in any version of the Ford Explorer, many reviewers found that comfort decreases significantly when comparing the front, middle and back row seats. Taller passengers in particular may find it very challenging to ride comfortably in the back seats of the Explorer. \n\n![2019-ford-explorer-interior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6m9516icHUQ0by8tB93hcE/b9f815daed1be486b40c11215585f198/2019-ford-explorer-interior1.jpg)\n\nWhile reviews frequently cite the comfortable and supportive feel of the Explorer’s front seats, they are as likely to mention the stiff and restrictive seatbacks of the back row seats. Comfort in the Explorer may depend on where one is seated in the truck. \n\nThe Ford Explorer seats up to seven people with cloth as a standard feature for interior upholstery. Captain’s chairs are an optional upgrade for the middle row of seats. Other potential upgrades include leather seats, power adjustable front seats, a leather wrapped and heated steering wheel, heated and cooled front seats, power folding back row seats, and heated outboard middle row seats. \n\nThe Ford Explorer has three LATCH child-seat connectors. In trucks with a middle bench style seat, the middle seat has an upper tether and lower anchors can be used from either side. Reviewers found the Ford Explorer’s LATCH connectors to be fairly challenging to find for inexperienced users. \n\nThe Explorer has three complete sets of LATCH child-seat connections. In models with the second row-bench seat, the middle seat has a tether anchor and it can borrow the lower anchors from either side. All four tether anchors are hard to find, but the lower anchors are set fairly deep in the seats.\n\nThe Explorer offers plenty of space for passengers in all three rows. The front seats are plush and supportive, but the last row has hard upper seatbacks.\n\n![2019-ford-explorer-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4Zr54NtNQvaXztSHyJ8gR8/464af373d422013f90ad74fb98306bac/2019-ford-explorer-interior2.jpg)\n\n### Utility \u0026 Practicality\n\nThe 2019 Ford Explorer offers one of the largest trunks in the class of mid-size SUVs. 21 cubic feet of space are available when all seats are upright and the vehicle is filled with up to 7 passengers.  With the back row folded down, the Explorer has 43.9 feet of cubic space. With the back and middle rows folded down, the Explorer offers a massive 81.7 cubic feet of cargo space. \n\n![2019-ford-explorer-exterior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1Fv9U3UlVydAxcT0LFdi9i/51a38c59ce31c2b014d52649a0ebf260/2019-ford-explorer-exterior2.jpg)\n\nPower folding back row seats and a hand’s free liftgate are possible upgrades which enhance the utility and practicality of this truck. If cargo space is extremely important, this year’s Explorer is a great option to consider. \n\n### Technology \u0026 Infotainment\n\nThe Ford Explorer includes a number of technologies which help it to stand out against an increasingly crowded pack of mid-size SUVs. This year’s model features: a rearview camera, the SYNC infotainment interface, a 4.2-inch color display, Bluetooth, a USB port, a six-speaker stereo, and the MyKey system as standard options. \n\nReviewers cite the layout of the infotainment and onboard technology to be high points which help to make the case that the Ford Explorer is an SUV worth considering. In particular, the SYNC 3 infotainment system has been praised for its simple and intuitive layout. Many reviewers felt this system could be easily and reliably operated by passengers of all ages and ability levels. \n\nThis year’s Ford Explorer can be upgraded to include: proximity key entry, push-button start, remote start, dual-zone automatic climate control, a seven-speaker stereo, a 12-speaker Sony audio system, satellite radio, two second-row USB ports, the SYNC 3 touch-screen system, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, a 110-volt household-style power outlet, navigation, a Wi-Fi hot spot, a twin-panel moonroof, and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Safety \u0026 Driving Assistance\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found the Ford Explorer performed well in crash tests. It received a safety rating of 5 out of 5 ratings for front and side crash tests.  It received 4 out of 5 stars for rollover tests. \n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety was more critical of the Ford Explorer’s safety. While it did receive the highest scores possible for four crash tests, it received the second lowest rating of marginal for driver-side small overlap front crash testing. It also received the lowest rating of poor for passenger safety during crash testing. It also received the lowest rating for headlights and front crash prevention effectiveness. \n\nMany reviewers cite safety concerns as one of the major red flags which keep the Ford Explorer from entering into the top two thirds of four-door SUVs. \n\nThe Ford Explorer can be upgraded to include front and rear parking sensors, a front-view parking camera, rain-sensing windshield wipers, automatic high beams, blind spot monitoring, rear cross traffic alert, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, and automatic parking assist.\n\nStandard 2019 Ford Explorer Safety Features:\n\n- Driver Air Bag\n- Passenger Air Bag\n- Front Head Air Bag\n- Rear Head Airbag\n- Front Side Air Bag\n- 4-Wheel ABS\n- 4-Wheel Disc Brakes\n- Brake Assist\n- Electronic Stability Control\n- Daytime Running Lights\n- Child Safety Locks\n- Traction Control\n\n### Driving Experience\n\nThis year’s Ford Explorer has a 3.5 liter V6 engine that pushes up to 290 horsepower. The upgraded engine options are a 280-horsepower, turbocharged 2.3-liter four-cylinder and a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 that manages up to 365 horsepower. A six-speed automatic transmission is standard in all trims of the Explorer. \n\nReviewers found all three of the Explorer’s engines to be powerful and well-suited for handling a variety of daily driving situations. Predictably, the strongest V6 engine feels the most muscular and aggressive.\n\nSome reviewers felt that trims below the Sport level suffered when it comes to consistent and reliable handling. The Sport suspension and larger wheels offer a rougher ride with the increased benefit of more nimble handling. \n\nOn all Ford Explorer’s front-wheel drive is standard and four-wheel drive is an optional upgrade. \n\n### Fuel efficiency\n\nThe 2019 Ford Explorer’s standard V6 and optional twin-turbo V-6 engines were cited by reviewers as being particularly inefficient when it comes to conserving gasoline. The optional turbocharged Ecoboost 4 cylinder engine however is able to offer much better fuel economy when compared to the other options. \n\nThe 3.5-liter V-6 with all-wheel drive manages just 16 miles per gallon in the city and 22 miles per gallon on the highway. A similar Explorer with front wheel drive is able to push 17 mpg in the city and 24 mpg on the highway. \n\nThe 2.3-liter turbo-4 available on the XLT and Limited trims is able to get 19 mpg in the city and 27 mpg on the highway.\n\nThough the Ford Explorer is not one of the most fuel efficient SUVs out there, the turbo-4 Ecoboost engine does help to make a better case for the fuel economy potential of this truck. \n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n### Pricing \u0026 Value\n\nThe 2019 Ford Explorer is available in five unique trim levels offering a variety of different features: Ford Explorer, Ford Explorer XLT, Ford Explorer Limited, Ford Explorer Sport, and Ford Explorer Platinum. The base, XLT and Limited versions are  available in both front or all-wheel drive, the Sport and Platinum can only be equipped with all-wheel drive.

Dodge first sold the Charger for the 1966 model year and positioned it as a real American muscle car that competed with the [Ford Mustang](https://www.autolist.com/ford-mustang) and [Chevrolet Camaro](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-camaro). \n\nThe Charger changed shapes and styles over the years until 1987, when it was discontinued.  Dodge brought the beloved car back for the 2006 model year as a sedan, a style very different from the Charger’s muscle car origins. Even so, newer versions of the Dodge Charger are available in luxurious and very high-performance trim levels that blur the line between four-door family cars and full-on muscle cars.\n\nThe Charger is aimed at families that need the space of a vehicle like an SUV but want sporty handling and sedan styling. Buyers seeking performance will also find that the Dodge Charger is available with up to 707 horsepower in the SRT Hellcat trim.\n\nThe Charger is positioned as a high-performance alternative to the common sedans offered by other companies and has more aggressive styling as a result.  Many would even consider the Charger as a competitor in the sports car space, as its raw power and acceleration puts it in the running with American muscle cars like the [Ford Mustang](https://www.autolist.com/ford-mustang) and [Chevrolet Camaro](https://www.autolist.com/chevrolet-camaro).  Many of the Charger's powertrain options are also under the hood of Dodge's true muscle car, the [Challenger](https://www.autolist.com/dodge-challenger).  o many in fact, that the Charger can be accurately called a four-door muscle car.\n\nSharing much of its engineering with the [Chrysler 300](https://www.autolist.com/chrysler-300), the Dodge Charger has been on sale for nearly ten years in its current form.  While it has evolved over the years, the Charger has not been majorly overhauled for the new model year. Updates for 2019 include a new GT performance trim, a new all-wheel drive SXT model, and performance upgrades for the SRT Hellcat and Scat Pack trims. Other Charger features carry over, including the engine lineup and most trim levels.\n\nAll-wheel drive is a new option for the 2019 model year, but is only available for the base SXT trim. Rear-wheel drive is standard for all other models.\n\n### Exterior\n\nThe 2019 Dodge Charger's exterior has been updated differently depending on the trim level.  GT and R/T trims have new chassis tuning, new aerodynamic trim pieces, and a new rear deck spoiler. The SRT Hellcat and Scat Pack both have a new grille with air inlets.  he Charger comes standard with 17-inch wheels for the base SXT trim, 19-inch wheels for GT and R/T trims, and 20-inch wheels for the Scat Pack and SRT Hellcat models.\n\n![2019-dodge-charger-exterior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5wWLGSuP4CH1FNm2Y7C55r/46e2355f3251a9e46478ce79cfca1260/2019-dodge-charger-exterior1.jpg)\n\nFourteen exterior color choices are available for the Charger, ranging from mainstream shades of black and grey to flashy colors like Plum Crazy (purple) and Go Mango (bright orange).  Dodge also offers special paint and appearance options for the Charger, including a matte black painted hood, racing stripes, special logos, and painted brake calipers.\n\n\nThe Dodge Charger rides on either a 120.2-inch or 120.4-inch wheelbase which makes it notably larger than competitors like the [Toyota Avalon](https://www.autolist.com/toyota-avalon) at 113 inches and the [Genesis G80](https://www.autolist.com/genesis) at 118.5 inches.\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n### Interior\n\nInside, the Dodge Charger has been updated for 2019 to include new leather options for lower trim levels and a Cold Weather package that includes heated cloth seats and a heated steering wheel.\n\nThe Charger's front seats have been praised as being firm but supportive, with extra points for comfort on longer trips.  The driver's seat is six-way power adjustable, and when combined with telescoping steering adjustments, there is a comfortable position for nearly any driver in the Charger.\n\nRear legroom is generous, and the rear seat is wide enough to accommodate two adults and a child or two full-size car seats. The sloping roofline does cut into rear head room and may make it harder for tall passengers to enter and exit the rear seat.\n\n![2019-dodge-charger-interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/LjB92LTQt1HCOz0C0FuRZ/7cfde7fe960aad889cba01aada4dcea0/2019-dodge-charger-interior2.jpg)\n\nThe Charger’s dash layout is clean and intuitive, with most controls oriented toward the driver.  Some functions like climate settings are repeated between physical buttons and the infotainment system touchscreen, which may be confusing for some.\n\n### Utility and Practicality\n\nThere is no denying the Dodge Charger's performance abilities, and because it's a full-size sedan, there is plenty of interior space as well. The Charger’s 16.5 cubic feet of trunk space bests other vehicles in the segment, but the area is narrow inside and the lift-over height makes loading and unloading heavy items more difficult.\n\n![2019-dodge-charger-exterior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6OUNGYm7LXlhcnZb17IvBI/b879987a3c6e361c8e9bd1afa230e37e/2019-dodge-charger-exterior2.jpg)\n\nWhile there is plenty of overall interior space, several reviewers knock the Charger for lacking door-pocket and small-item storage. Many people will also find that the Charger's cupholders are too small, struggling to fit more than a soda can.\n\n### Technology \u0026 Infotainment\n\nDodge vehicles use the same UConnect infotainment system that is found in other vehicles from FCA, and it is widely regarded as one of the best and easiest to use systems in the industry.  The SXT trim comes with a 7-inch touchscreen, while all others come with an 8.4-inch screen.  Both screen sizes have colorful displays that are easily viewable from any angle and the UConnect software is very easy to learn and navigate.\n\n![2019-dodge-charger-interior1](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7iDXqOhol7yNqjyUSZeXSi/ddb95fa4a1d25710a0898a63d0ed709d/2019-dodge-charger-interior1.jpg)\n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, along with Bluetooth phone and audio, voice commands, and two USB ports. The larger screen also includes SiriusXM Radio.  Navigation is optional, along with a Harmon-Kardon 19-speaker stereo, but most people will find that the maps included with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto are more than good enough.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n### Safety and Driving Assistance\n\nAll Dodge Charger models come standard with a rear parking assist system and a backup camera, but advanced safety features require the addition of options packages. The Driver Confidence Group includes blind spot monitors and rear cross-traffic alerts, while the Technology Group brings automatic high beams, full-speed forward collision warnings, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warnings and rain sensing wipers.\n\nThe Charger earned “Good” ratings in most IIHS crash test areas, with notable exceptions in driver-side crash safety and child seat ease of use, which were both rated as \"Marginal\".  Headlights were also noted as a weakness, earning a “Poor” rating in IIHS safety testing.  When equipped with optional safety equipment, the Dodge Charger has a “Superior” rating for front crash prevention.\n\nThese ratings place the Charger behind some of its competitors, many of which have earned a Top Safety Pick + rating from the IIHS. The NHTSA gave the Charger four stars in front crash testing and five stars for side impact and rollover protection.\n\n### Driving Experience\n\nThe Charger is available with four engines, ranging from the 300-horsepower 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 to the 707-horsepower supercharged 6.2-liter Hemi SRT Hellcat V8.  All models come with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The Scat Pack and SRT Hellcat models also include line-lock functions.\n\nThe Dodge Charger is unique in its class, offering the only sedan with both a V8 engine and rear-wheel drive. Acceleration is brisk, even with the base engine in place, but V6 Chargers fall short of quicker front-drive competitors like the Nissan Maxima. \n\nCharger SXT, SXT AWD, and GT trim levels get the 3.6-liter V6 engine that has 292 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque for SXT trim or 300 horsepower and 264 lb-ft of torque for GT trim.\n\nThe R/T trim comes with a 5.7-liter Hemi V8 engine that has 370 horsepower and 395 lb-ft of torque.\n\nThe Scat Pack model comes with a 6.4-liter Hemi V8 engine, also called the \"392\" for its displacement.  This engine has 485 horsepower and 475 lb-ft of torque. The Charger Daytona also comes with this engine.\n\nThe Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat gets a 6.2-liter Supercharged Hemi V8 engine that has 707 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque.\n\nPerformance is where the Charger excels against all others in its class.  Scat Pack and SRT Hellcat models are breathtaking in their acceleration abilities, and the SRT Hellcat comes with race inspired performance tricks to keep it running under the harshest of conditions.  New this year, the Hellcat's exterior body work has been enhanced to bring greater cooling and aerodynamics at high speeds.  Line lock holds the front brakes so that the car can execute a burnout, and there is a feature called after run chiller that uses the air conditioner's compressor to push air through the engine bay and help protect against damage after hard use.\n\nThis is all good enough to help the SRT Hellcat run a quarter mile in 11.8 seconds and achieve a 204 MPH top speed.  Those are race car numbers that no other road-going sedan in the Charger's price range can match.  The 8-speed automatic transmission shifts quickly and is a solid match for the brutal power from the Hellcat's supercharged engine.\n\nThe Charger’s ride is quiet and composed and the interior comfort benefits greatly from plenty of sound deadening.  With the larger 20-inch wheels equipped, road obstacles like cracks and small potholes become more noticeable, but not unpleasant.  Some drivers may find that the SRT Hellcat's Hemi V8 is loud at highway cruising speeds.  Several reviewers note that the noise can become tiresome on longer trips, but is very satisfying under heavy acceleration.\n\nFront and rear visibility take a hit from large pillars at both ends of the vehicle.  Reviewers have noted difficulty when turning and changing lanes.\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-box-breaker\"}\n\n### Fuel Efficiency\n\nThe Charger can be relatively fuel-efficient with the base V6 engine in place, rated at up to 30 mpg on the highway and 19 mpg in the city.  These numbers place the Charger right in line with most others in the segment, like the Nissan Maxima and Genesis G80.  The Buick Lacrosse is the most fuel-efficient of the group with up to 35 highway mpg in certain trims.\n\nAll three of the V8 engines struggle to achieve 25 mpg on the highway and fare much worse in city driving, ranging between 13 and 16 mpg.  The performance tradeoff here is steep, but there are no other vehicles in the segment that offer rear-wheel drive and a V8.\n\n### Pricing and Value\n\nAs of 2019, the Charger’s overall design is nearly ten years old.  There are plenty of more contemporary options in the segment, but Dodge has made updates to the Charger over the years to keep it relevant and appealing.\n\nWith an MSRP of $29,220 before destination charges, the Dodge Charger is considered to be a good value.  Base SXT models are well-equipped and they mostly deliver the utility that full-size sedan buyers expect.  Standard features include LED daytime running lights, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, USB inputs, folding rear seats, cruise control, the 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 engine, and rear parking sensors.  All-wheel drive adds $4,000 to the price.  This starting price is also in line with other vehicles in the segment and even undercuts some, like the $32,000 Maxima.\n\nThe Charger GT has an MSRP $31,495 and includes 20-inch wheels, performance seats and steering wheel, and remote keyless entry/start.\n\nCharger R/T models have an MSRP of $35,995 and have a 370-horsepower 5.7-liter V8 Hemi engine, an 8.4-inch touchscreen and a performance exhaust.\n\nThe Charger Scat Pack has an MSRP of $39,995 and has a 485-horsepower 6.4-liter V8 Hemi engine, Brembo brakes, and SRT performance upgrades.\n\nEven the SRT Hellcat, with its $67,245 price tag can be considered a bargain.  It is equipped with a 707-horsepower supercharged 6.2-liter Hemi V8, has a 204 MPH top speed, and plenty of performance parts.  No other sedan offers near-supercar levels of performance at the Hellcat’s price point.  The nearest rivals would be the [BMW M5](https://www.autolist.com/bmw-m5) or a Mercedes-AMG, both of which are much more expensive.\n\nIn addition to the several trim levels and options, the Charger also has packages that can be added to upgrade looks and performance.  The Daytona package is available with the R/T and R/T Scat Pack trims and has special interior leather, Daytona exterior decals and paint, upgraded lighting, and 20-inch wheels.\n\nThe Cold Weather Package is available for SXT, SXT AWD, GT, and R/T trims, and has a heated steering wheel, heated front seats, and heated exterior mirrors.","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Sedan","Review"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/dodge-charger#year_min=2019\u0026year_max=2019","modified_date":"2019-05-17T17:34:24.224Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6iZgGGAUwHRPVmmc68ZU2R/f9ad5f71d7e66a0a23798fe080c69f8d/nissan_altima_hero-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1RSL0LdS228xp2Xj3iWuOB/f00dd3fa57d399862ca4ac2264830a63/nissan_altima_thumbnail-image.jpg","slug":"2019-nissan-altima-review","title":"Driven: 2019 Nissan Altima","publication_date":"2019-02-11T06:00-08:00","content_summary":"Nissan’s Altima is all-new for 2019 and it brings with it sharp new styling, a new optional turbo engine and a variety of safety features.

It competes against industry stalwarts like the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, Volkswagen Passat, Ford Fusion, Chevy Malibu, Hyundai Sonata and Kia Optima.\n\nThe Altima was redesigned for the 2019 model year. This sixth-generation model brought with it bold new exterior styling, a tech-savvy optional turbo engine, the availability of all-wheel-drive and a wide variety of standard active safety features. \n\nWithin Nissan’s lineup, the Altima is larger than the bite-sized Versa and the compact Sentra and smaller than the full-size Maxima. \n\nThe Altima comes in a variety of trim levels: the base S, SR, SV, SL and Platinum, plus a limited-edition ‘Edition ONE’ model.\n\nAll models come with one of two engines. Base models use a 2.5-liter, four-cylinder engine that makes 188 horsepower and 180 pound-feet of torque; a CVT gearbox is standard. \n\nAn optional 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine is also available on the SR and Platinum models and is standard on the Edition One.  It replaces the previous V6 option and makes 248 horsepower and 280 pound-feet of torque and is also paired with a CVT gearbox. This engine is notable for being able to vary its compression ratio (all other engines have a fixed ratio). This allows the engine to be efficient when it needs to be and powerful when it needs to be, giving drivers the best of both worlds. \n\nFront-wheel-drive is standard on all models, regardless of engine type. All-wheel-drive is a new option and will run you an additional $1,350. \n\n---\n\n## What’s good\n*TLDR: Green, capable and handsome.*\n\n![2019 Nissan Altima-6](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/nAHd7CW1YAetL0xmZN4U8/4917827c5ae24c6907f6d573879249ff/2019_Nissan_Altima-6.jpg) \n\n\n__Hey handsome.__ Nissan hit a home run with the exterior styling on the Altima. Front to back, side to side, it’s sharp and modern without being too experimental or weird. It also avoids the bland malaise of other vanilla midsize sedans. This was one of our favorite elements of the new Altima.\n\n__AWD.__ With Ford about to sunset its Fusion sedan, there aren’t many models in the midsize sedan segment that offer the option of all-wheel-drive (Subaru’s Legacy sedan is the obvious exception here). By making this an option, Nissan wisely opens the Altima up to a variety of buyers in snowy climates who prefer sedans over larger, bulkier crossovers, but still covet the traction of AWD. This is a nice ace up the Altima’s sleeve. \n\n__Efficient.__ The Altima does a nice job sipping gas, relative to its competitors. The optional turbo model is especially efficient, beating out the optional engines on the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata and Kia Optima. \n\n---\n\n## What’s bad\n*TLDR: Unremarkable to drive and live with, weak transmission, no hybrid.*\n\n![2019 Nissan Altima-20](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/gvisVDWnoUCh0dnbvfdev/c59227ed6a9705091f109d03ae2bf5ca/2019_Nissan_Altima-20.jpg)\n\n__Not special.__ While the exterior styling is handsome, our overall impression of the Altima was lukewarm. Nothing about it felt particularly extraordinary, especially when compared to rivals like the Honda Accord, Mazda6 and Toyota Camry. Those models have better refinement, materials and build quality. On the Altima, however, the interior design and materials felt subpar and basic and there was little to get excited about with this car as a whole. Our test model cost about $30,000 and nothing about it felt like it was worth that kind of money. \n\n__CVT.__ We’ve said it about a variety of vehicles that rely on a CVT gearbox for fuel efficiency: these are no fun to drive. Yes, they give you decent fuel economy but they aren’t as responsive as a convention automatic transmission with fixed gears and they often make the engine drone when you accelerate. \n\n__No hybrid.__ Currently, the Altima doesn’t offer any type of hybrid or plug-in hybrid variant (the Ford Fusion, Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Hyundai Sonata and Kia Optima all do). This is a letdown for buyers who like the Altima’s styling and other features but still want strong fuel economy numbers. \n\n---\n\n## 5 stars of execution\n\nSafety Features? __YES__\n-    All Altima models — including the base S models — come standard with pre-collision alerts and braking and Intelligent Trace Control (helps the car corner better for safety).  \n-    The 2019 Altima is also a Top Safety Pick by the independent Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. \n-    We were disappointed that all Altimas didn’t come standard with things like blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control and lane-keep assist. Such features are standard on base models of the Accord and Camry but you have to jump up to the $29,000 Altima SV to get them standard. \n\n\nValue? __YES__\n-    The Altima packs in many nice standard features for its $24,795 base price, goodies like Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity, an eight-inch touchscreen infotainment system, power driver’s seat, the aforementioned safety features, backup camera and remote start.\n-    Numerous other trim levels above that S model make it easy for buyers to pick the Altima to suit their budget.\n-    Our only gripe about the Altima’s value was the aforementioned lack of some active safety features that are standard on competitors from Honda and Toyota. \n\nEfficiency? __YES__\n-    As we mentioned, the Altima has great efficiency, particularly the optional turbo models. \n-    Most base, front-wheel-drive models are rated at 28/39/32 MPG city/highway/combined.\n-    The turbo FWD models are rated at 25/34/29 MPG. \n\nDriving experience? __NO__\n-    Between the underachieving CVT gearbox and the lack of overall refinement in the Altima, we were left disappointed in how it drove.\n-    The main highlight was the base engine’s reasonable power, despite having less power than many of its rivals. \n-    The crisp handling and responsive steering from the previous-generation are also missing in this new 2019 model. \n\n![2019-Nissan-Altima-Photo-15](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4WVX8guPh6CYD0z3a9YFJO/a6f499bf022bf44dd5e8dbf182380325/2019-Nissan-Altima-Photo-15.jpg) \n\nExecution? __NO__\n-    Given how good the Honda Accord, Mazda6 and Kia Optima are right now, we were hoping Nissan would come out with a rival that could go toe-to-toe.\n-    But overall this new Altima feels disappointing; there just isn’t anything about it that’s notable.\n-    It feels like an uninspired rental car at a time when its peers are bringing new levels of refinement, dynamics and style to the sedan segment.\n\n\n##  Total Rating:  3 stars\n\n---\n\n## What’s it gonna cost me?\nAs we mentioned, the base Altima S starts at $24,795, including destination but without options. \n\nThat model comes with the 2.5-liter, four-cylinder engine, front-wheel-drive, Bluetooth, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity, an eight-inch touchscreen infotainment system, a power driver’s seat, pre-collision alerts and braking, Intelligent Trace Control, a backup camera, keyless entry, remote start and a 60/40 split rear seat that folds. \n\nThe SR starts at $26,145 and adds 19-inch alloy wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, paddle shifters, LED exterior headlights, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and leather-wrapped steering wheel.\n\nThe 2.0-liter turbo version of the SR adds the 248-horsepower engine for another $3,950 ($30,195 total). The engine upgrade also includes goodies like additional exterior and interior trim pieces, dual exhaust tips and heated front seats.\n\nThe SV model (with the base, non-turbo engine) is $28,975 and comes with a power moonroof, adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist, lane-center assist, pedestrian detection on its pre-collision alerts and braking, rear parking sensors, rear automatic braking and dual-zone climate control.\n\n\n![2019 Nissan Altima-21](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5k99toYHuak1pS7klOFrL9/e7ba095bdadc988fa1df017c9ede0800/2019_Nissan_Altima-21.jpg) \n\nThe SL starts at $30,885 and adds navigation, leather seats, power passengers seat, a nine-speaker Bose sound system, remote connectivity abilities and wood trim. \n\nThe high-end Platinum model caps things off. For a starting price of $32,825, it comes with unique 19-inch alloy wheels, driver’s memory seat, a 360-degree parking camera and active noise cancellation. The Platinum model can also be had with the optional turbo engine.\n\nAll the aforementioned trims come standard with front-wheel-drive; all-wheel-drive is a $1,350 option on all of them. \n\n\n---\n\n## Also consider\nThe Altima is in a shrinking segment of family sedans that have historically been some of the best-selling models on the market — but as crossovers grow in popularity, sedan sales are waning. \n\nStill, there are some excellent rivals you should check out if this Altima has caught your eye. \n\nHonda’s Accord is the most well-rounded model in the segment. It offers surprising refinement and amenities, excellent standard safety gear, efficient engines and handsome if understated, styling. \n\nMazda’s 6 sedan is the best-looking AND the best-handling sedan in the segment, bar none. It also has class-leading styling and refinement inside. We can’t recommend it enough. \n\nKia’s Optima is aging very well and packs in impressive refinement and style, plus a variety of powertrains (like a plug-in hybrid). \n\nChevy’s refined, comfortable and handsome Malibu is also worth a look. \n\nSkip Hyundai’s weak Sonata, Ford’s soon-to-be-discontinued Fusion and the aging VW Passat.\n","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Review","Sedan"],"ctaText":"Browse Altima Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/nissan-altima#year_min=2019\u0026year_max=2020","modified_date":"2019-04-18T21:20:18.613Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/60ZZHPDEqouItb1QZ49dyY/c07caace99e5aa82fdf88c1af0820acc/2019_Toyota_RAV4_hero-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2oOSJgL3QR1kGLqRBufgcN/666db2727d1ef61476c0d4b1e6719f40/2019_Toyota_RAV4_thumb-image.jpg","slug":"2019-toyota-rav4-review","title":"Driven: 2019 Toyota RAV4","publication_date":"2019-02-08T06:00-08:00","content_summary":"Autolist 2019 Toyota RAV4 Review - Toyota’s RAV4 practically invented the compact crossover segment decades ago and while it’s always been a strong seller, various elements of it have been sub-par.

It’s larger than the subcompact C-HR and smaller than the Highlander three-row crossover. It’s also much different than Toyota’s truck-based 4Runner SUV. \n\nAn all-new fifth-generation RAV4 was introduced for the 2019 model year. \n\nThis model comes with either a gas engine or a hybrid powertrain. \n\nThis review focuses on the gas model, which uses a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 203 horsepower and 184 pound-feet of torque. It’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission on all models. \n\nFront-wheel-drive is standard on the gas RAV4, while all-wheel-drive is a $1,400 option on all models except the Adventure, where it’s standard. \n\nThat  AWD system that's standard on the Adventure and optional on the top-end Limited trim is a more sophisticated setup than is available on lesser RAV4 models and it includes torque vectoring. \n\nAll models with either of the available AWD systems also come with a terrain-select feature with mud/sand, rock/dirt and snow modes.\n\nThe RAV4 Hybrid uses an electric motor and a 2.5-liter gas engine for a combined 219 horsepower. \n\nThere are five trim levels on the new RAV4: LE, XLE, XLE Premium, Adventure and Limited. A new TRD Off-Road trim level will join the RAV4 lineup in 2020. \n\nThe Hybrid model has four trims: LE, XLE, XSE (a sport-oriented model) and Limited. \n\n---\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n## What’s good\n*TLDR: Looks tough, built tough, super useful.*\n\n__Tough stuff.__ Whereas the styling on the four previous generations of the RAV4 was never particularly memorable or noteworthy, this new generation amps up the ruggedness inside and out. The interior is a savvy blend of function, refinement and comfort (though our Adventure test model had odd orange trim pieces). The outside takes a page from Subaru’s design handbook by going for the outdoorsy, capable look. It works all around.\n\n![2019 Toyota Adventure Ruby 055 8514D4EFEFB831A5096AE129F2BAF495A06683CA](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1YvaSAKByx6xjXJtdI7BUx/f7335e6042f2d3e3340dcbf1d27e3a82/2019_Toyota_Adventure_Ruby_055_8514D4EFEFB831A5096AE129F2BAF495A06683CA.jpg)\n\n__Good bones.__ This new generation of RAV4 is built on a new platform that Toyota uses on a variety of its latest vehicles. This lends a refined, quiet character to the RAV4 while also boosting its handling and safety chops. \n\n__Practicality abound.__ The inside of the RAV4 shows that Toyota took its time to figure out how people use their crossovers for daily life. The seats are comfortable (and the ones in the rear fold completely flat), the ergonomics of the dashboard are excellent, there’s plenty of space for five tall adults to ride in comfort (a flat floor in the back seat helps) and there are storage cubbies, cupholders and pockets galore. Plus a healthy amount of cargo room in the back.\n\n{ad type=\"dt-wide-breaker\"}\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n\n## What’s bad\n*TLDR: Indecisive transmission, stiff ride, cheap plastics in the trunk area.*\n\n__Finicky transmission.__ Modern automatic transmissions have sophisticated programming that makes sure they’re always in the right gear to maximize fuel efficiency. The good ones do this seamlessly. Unfortunately, the one in this RAV4 isn’t great. It seems to always be hunting for the right gear and it shifted too often in that search. Many of the RAV4’s rivals don’t have this issue. \n\n__Stiff suspension.__ The handling on our RAV4 Adventure test model was fine but the suspension was oddly stiff for our taste. It lent a slightly cheap feel to the ride quality of the RAV4, which was otherwise solid. \n\n![2019 Toyota Adventure Ruby 086 793EEAB4DE48F01716218FAD6AF6CE936D528FA6](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1Hl5QrqNEnw5UUBKUvYW7A/b43fab309f0d6e045310e0df47272a32/2019_Toyota_Adventure_Ruby_086_793EEAB4DE48F01716218FAD6AF6CE936D528FA6.jpg) \n\n__Cheap trunk.__ While the materials used throughout most of the RAV4’s interior were durable and high-quality, the plastics that Toyota used in the cargo area seemed cut-rate and cheap. This may seem like an odd thing to gripe about but the cargo space is the part of the interior that gets the most abuse. Cheap plastics like these don’t seem like they’re up to the task of withstanding decades of abuse. \n\n---\n\n## 5 stars of execution\n\n\n![2019 Toyota Adventure Ruby 036 0CD92915A2E53ED32B464655FEB1B920B0237379](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4HO17URtGP56YhQIBpOApS/e2fbd6a2899b81cba1d2a9ce2ded4406/2019_Toyota_Adventure_Ruby_036_0CD92915A2E53ED32B464655FEB1B920B0237379.jpg) \n\n\nSafety Features? __YES__\n-    All RAV4 models come standard with an impressive suite of active safety features. These include pre-collision warning and braking with low-light pedestrian detection and daytime cyclist detection, lane-departure alert with steering assist, radar cruise control and lane tracing.\n-    The RAV4 had not been crash-tested by NHTSA or the IIHS at the time of this publication but it is expected to get Five Stars from NHTSA and at least a Top Safety Pick rating from IIHS. \n\nValue? __YES__\n-    While the RAV4 isn’t a screaming deal, it’s certainly competitive with the other crossovers in its segment. \n-    Toyota also did a smart job of creating a trim level of the RAV4 suited for many budgets and needs – from the price-conscious to the outdoorsman/woman to the everyday family.\n-    Our favorite trim was the XLE Premium, which had both what you needed (plenty of safety and utility) and what you wanted (moonroof, faux leather seats) for an attractive $30,595.\n\n\n![2019 Toyota Adventure Ruby 031 E94E79B57F4DDAEB29B075D743A88B855BF49D75](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2I4N0W8I3aNYXwGf0GAuSp/959052189a43df5931c344d5f3780f61/2019_Toyota_Adventure_Ruby_031_E94E79B57F4DDAEB29B075D743A88B855BF49D75.jpg) \n\nEfficiency? __YES__\n-    Nearly all models of the 2019 Toyota RAV4 AWD are rated at 25/33/28 MPG city/highway/combined.\n-    Despite not offering a turbocharged engine, those numbers make the gas-powered RAV4 one of the most fuel-efficient models in its class – and that’s not even the RAV4 Hybrid version. It outpaces models like the Ford Escape and Nissan Rogue among other models in the segment in terms of efficiency. \n-    Only Honda’s CR-V with the 1.5-liter turbo and AWD beats the RAV4 AWD. \n\nDriving experience? __YES__\n-    With a peppy engine, communicative steering and comfy seats, the RAV4 was a perfectly fine daily driver.\n-    The RAV4’s ace in the hole is the fact that its engine isn’t turbocharged. While turbo engines have better fuel economy test results, those gains often don’t translate into the real world…and turbos don’t have the immediate power and acceleration as naturally-aspirated engines like the RAV4’s. This gives the Toyota a leg up on many of its competitors. \n-    The only downside to the RAV4’s driving experience was its aforementioned transmission issues, though they were more annoying than concerning. \n\nExecution? __YES__\n-    Toyota nailed this RAV4. It took what was previously a good vehicle – albeit one with underwhelming style and build quality – and turned it into a handsome, capable and refined crossover. \n-    There is very little this RAV4 can’t do and it will suit the needs of a huge number of buyers.\n-    We have no qualms recommending it to anyone in the crossover market. \n\n![2019 Toyota Adventure Ruby 082 8176D663350FA7E48319366E6AE8F91023A7CB41](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2z3UZ9rh5hrWe3Cp6uTwBV/3926ffb1578f11a277eaaa19db8a16fa/2019_Toyota_Adventure_Ruby_082_8176D663350FA7E48319366E6AE8F91023A7CB41.jpg) \n\n##  Total Rating:  5 stars\n\n---\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-2\"}\n\n## What’s it gonna cost me?\nThe base __RAV4 LE__ starts at $26,595, including destination. \n\nIt comes standard with the aforementioned active safety equipment, 17-inch steel wheels with covers, LED headlights, daytime running lights, chrome exhaust tips, tinted windows, backup camera, a 4.2-inch digital display in the instrument panel, 60/40 split rear seat that folds flat, steering wheel controls, keyless entry, a seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system with six speakers, Apple CarPlay, Bluetooth, WiFi connectivity, and an anti-theft system. \n\nThe __XLE__ starts at $28,395 and adds to this blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, 17-inch alloy wheels, fog lights, heated and folding mirrors, moonroof, power driver’s seat, dual-zone climate control, cargo area cover and five USB ports. \n\nThe __XLE Premium__ starts at $30,595 and adds 19-inch alloy wheels, power tailgate, faux-leather seats and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift lever. __This is the model we’d choose if it were our money__: regardless of whether you add AWD, it’s a great mix of value, safety, comfort and amenities. \n\nThe aforementioned models all come standard with front-wheel-drive; AWD is a $1,400 option on each. \n\nThe more rugged __Adventure__ model is next in the lineup, starting at $33,995 (this was the model we tested). It adds its sophisticated AWD system as standard plus unique 19-inch alloy wheels, exterior trim upgrades like bigger fender flares, silver-painted trim, active grille shutters for improved fuel economy, panoramic backup camera, customizable digital instrument panel with seven-inch display screen, orange trim pieces on the faux-leather seats and dashboard and a larger eight-inch touchscreen for the infotainment.\n![2019 Toyota RAV4 Limited FWD MagneticGrayMetallic 45 4F2C6228EC29AD5451193BDD26367A2BA9D95E0C](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6HtfUN3jz4Hbohfe2NxkC4/f4269bfd80d5354c5a71ba8fc123753f/2019_Toyota_RAV4_Limited_FWD_MagneticGrayMetallic_45_4F2C6228EC29AD5451193BDD26367A2BA9D95E0C.jpg)\n\n\nThe luxury-oriented __Limited__ model, seen above, starts at $34,595. It comes with some unique exterior trim (like a dark grey grille and trim pieces), puddle lights, chrome-accented door handles, heated front seats, digital rearview mirror and a navigation system with POI search and voice recognition. Note that AWD isn’t standard on the Limited, it’s a $1,400 upcharge like all of the non-Adventure models. \n\nFinally, a new __TRD Off-Road__ model has been introduced for the 2020 model year. It will add burlier tires and wheels, a rugged suspension with increased ground clearance and unique interior and exterior trim that denotes its off-road inclinations. \n\n---\n\n## Also consider\nThe RAV4 is in one of the most popular segments in the entire industry: compact crossovers. So this means there will always be plenty of competition. \n\nOur overall favorite would be Honda’s CR-V; this crossover does everything very well and suits the needs of a huge group of buyers – including you. Until now, the CR-V has been the clear leader of the segment but this new RAV4 does give it a run for its money. Which is best comes down to your personal preference. \n\nSubaru’s Forester is another well-rounded winner in this segment that is definitely worth a look. \n\nWe also love the Mazda CX-5 for its exceptional styling, refinement and handling.\n\nFinally, the Jeep Compass has solid build quality, excellent off-road abilities and great styling. \n\n","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Review","CUV"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/toyota-rav4#year_min=2019\u0026year_max=2020","modified_date":"2019-04-18T21:18:32.876Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1sx98A9Lxgawf5I7o60PXg/a7fb2bf0fdd2307c4879a92f9daa521d/Honda_Passport_hero-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/67wlEz9ILPCSY2ChSJybfN/673e95628c4fd3aa38137d1d1057f070/Honda_Passport_thumb-image.jpg","slug":"2019-honda-passport-review","title":"Driven: 2019 Honda Passport","publication_date":"2019-01-29T06:00-08:00","content_summary":"Honda’s has resurrected the Passport name for 2019 after a nearly 20-year absence, now in the form of a five-seat crossover.

Yes, you may remember the Passport name from the Honda SUV that it sold here for nearly two decades in the 1990s and 2000s, but this is an altogether different model. \n\nThis new Passport is essentially the larger Honda Pilot with the Pilot’s third row of seats lopped off and a dose of extra ground clearance. The Passport is 6.2 inches shorter overall than the Pilot, it has 0.8 inches more of ground clearance and it seats five people. The Passport is larger and more expensive than Honda’s compact CR-V crossover.\n\nThe Passport is aimed at the more sporty, rugged-seeking buyer. It splits the difference between the more SUV-like Jeep Grand Cherokee and Toyota 4Runner with on-road rivals like the Ford Edge, Nissan Murano, Chevy Blazer and Hyundai Santa Fe. \n\nThe Passport comes with a single powertrain that it shares with the higher-end trims of the Pilot. This includes a 3.5-liter V6 engine that makes 280 horsepower and 262 pound-feet of torque, and a nine-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel-drive is standard on nearly all trim levels, while AWD is a $1,900 option.\n\nThere are four trim levels on the Passport: Sport, EX-L, Touring and Elite (Elite is the one with standard AWD).  \n\n---\n\n## What’s good\n*TLDR: Both the powertrain and the interior are aces.*\n__Great powertrain.__ 280 horsepower, 262 torque and a smooth-shifting nine-speed automatic made for a great combination on the loaded Elite test model we drove (which has standard AWD). The Passport never wanted for power during acceleration and even the handling was predictable and responsive. \n\n__The Interior Part I:__ Functionality. Highlights include rear seats that slide fore and aft, recline AND fold flat with the cargo floor, one-button seat-folding features, hidden space underneath that cargo floor and ample room all over for heads, knees, gear and cargo. The Passport’s interior is a home-run in execution and packaging, something Honda has long excelled at. \n\n![2019 Honda Passport 147](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2wm5aqEV6DRdWwDS4MRRWa/bb57f071a168a22b9de67078e7bceb40/2019_Honda_Passport_147.jpg)\n\n__The Interior Part II:__ Comfort. A quiet cabin, a comfortable ride and a well-designed dashboard come together to give Passport buyers more than just the interior’s functionality to drool over. The touchscreen infotainment system is also excellent. \n\n\n## What’s bad\n*TLDR: Thirstier than rivals, top trim needs more luxe, better suited to on-road adventures.*\n\n__Not an SUV.__ While Honda would like you to think that the Passport can go toe-to-toe with legendary off-roaders like Jeep’s Grand Cherokee and Toyota’s 4Runner, it’s not in the same league as those models. Marketing aside, this is a crossover -- not an ultra-rugged SUV. The good news? That’s fine for 99% of the Passport buyers considering that they’ll never take it off-road in the first place. \n\n__Not luxury.__ Though the loaded Passport Elite trim sells for $43,680 -- a near-luxury sum -- the inside lacks the high-end indulgence you might see on rivals with the same price tag. Things like wood trim, chrome trim (inside or out), a panoramic moonroof, higher-grade leather seats. This is a minor complaint since most buyers won’t even opt for the Elite trim (the EX-L will be the big seller) but it’d be nice to see what Honda could do in the near-luxury space. \n\n![2019 Honda Passport 162](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/19To6dj4BO0VWnyGXOPSCL/9e6b8e86e7f89b92861bfdb1346f4ff6/2019_Honda_Passport_162.jpg) \n\n__Gas hungry.__ Both the front-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive versions of the Passport don’t offer great fuel economy relative to most of its peers. This was a disappointment coming from a brand like Honda, one that knows its way around a fuel-efficient engine. \n\n---\n\n## 5 stars of execution\n\n\n![2019 Honda Passport 012](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2NrW9ZDSYkdJcPVwW9I496/853030cd3dfddeeb1211cd39781c1a6a/2019_Honda_Passport_012.jpg) \n\nSafety Features? __YES__\n- All Passport models come standard with Honda Sensing, a suite of active safety technologies. \n- This includes pre-collision warning and braking, lane-keep assist, lane-departure warning with road-departure mitigation and adaptive cruise control. \n- While NHTSA and IIHS haven’t crash-tested the Passport yet, Honda says it is confident that it will get a Five-Star rating from NHTSA and a Top Safety Pick Plus rating from IIHS (its highest rating). \n\nValue? __YES__\n- The Passport packs a fair number of amenities into each of its four trim levels. \n- It’s not a screaming deal compared to its peers, but the mix of features each trim has standard is certainly competitive. \n- But it’s important to note that unlike the Chevy Blazer and Ford Edge, the Passport doesn’t offer a sub-$30,000 base model with a cheaper powertrain, for those bargain-hunting crossover shoppers.\n\nEfficiency? __NO__\n- Front-wheel-drive Passports are rated at 20/25/22 MPG city/highway/combined while AWD models clock in at 19/24/21 MPG city/highway/combined. \n- Those AWD numbers are a little worse than the V6 Ford Edge AWD and definitely worse than Nissan’s Murano AWD (which also has a V6). \n\nDriving experience? __YES__\n- While the Passport isn’t particularly fuel efficient, at least it’s fun to drive (for what it is). \n- The 280-horsepower V6 has more than enough power to be fun on on-ramps or green lights, while the steering and handling nicely balance crispness and comfort. \n- It’s also relatively capable off-road, with the AWD system’s variable drive modes (snow/sand/mud) proving themselves plenty useful when needed. \n- We couldn’t find any fault with the way the Passport drove and would look forward to driving it on a daily basis. \n\nExecution? __YES__\n- With the Passport Honda did an excellent job creating a sporty, functional and comfortable crossover that will easily find a home between the smaller CR-V and the family-oriented three-row Pilot in Honda’s lineup. \n- Its flaws were few, namely paltry fuel economy and a dearth of luxury trappings on the high-end Elite trim. \n\n![2019 Honda Passport 176](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4akKK91ML9sK8yKHiNvcnh/9eb87dd8668d57f86eecd6db19160ff4/2019_Honda_Passport_176.jpg) \n\n##  Total Rating: 4 out of 5 stars\n\n---\n\n## What’s it gonna cost me?\nThe base Passport __Sport__ starts at $33,035, including destination. \n\nIt comes standard with front-wheel-drive, the aforementioned Honda Sensing active safety tech, 20-inch alloy wheels, the V-6 engine and nine-speed automatic transmission, LED headlights, fog lights and taillights, remote start, three-zone climate control, eight-way power driver’s seat, a and a six-speaker sound system. \n\nThe __EX-L__ starts at $37,455 (including destination) and adds leather seats that are heated up front, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a sunroof, a power tailgate, blind-spot monitoring, power passenger seat, a touchscreen infotainment system, Apple Carplay and Android Auto connectivity and satellite and HD radio. __This is the model we’d choose if we were buying a Passport. __\n\nThe __Touring__ model is next up, at $40,325, including destination. It comes with navigation, a hands-free power tailgate, parking sensors, LED headlights, roof rails, a 10-speaker audio system, power-folding mirrors and wider tires and wheels. \n\nAs mentioned, all-wheel-drive is another $1,900 for the three aforementioned models. \n\nAWD comes standard on the top-end __Elite__ trim, which starts at $44,725, including destination. This model also has ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, wireless phone charger and rain-sensing wipers. \n\n---\n\n## Also consider\nThe Passport is in a popular and growing segment of five-seat crossovers that are larger and more sophisticated than the compact models (like Honda’s CR-V) and smaller than the family three-row versions (Honda’s Pilot). Thus, competition is also heating up. \n\nWe would put the Passport at the top of the current crop of crossovers (say that three times fast) but you should also check out models like the Nissan Murano, Subaru Outback, Jeep Cherokee, and Hyundai Santa Fe.\n","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Review","CUV"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/honda-passport#year_min=2019\u0026year_max=2020","modified_date":"2019-04-18T21:16:17.739Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4T8JmGrZcaGj4966Upe81Y/e7dac2108b9a2d95ae21c469ad9da8cc/subaru_ascent_hero-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/429tYlClPp7Wm55lHCYswA/e9425d30643058680b01979eca6899c9/subaru_ascent_thumb-image.jpg","slug":"2019-subaru-ascent-review","title":"Driven: 2019 Subaru Ascent","publication_date":"2019-01-25T12:00-08:00","content_summary":"Subaru’s first-ever 2019 Ascent is the brand’s answer to the three-row, family crossover segment.

It’s a three-row, family crossover that can seat seven or eight passengers, depending on which model you choose. \n\nThe Ascent sits at the top of Subaru’s lineup of vehicles; it’s larger than the Outback wagon, the Forester crossover and everything else in the automaker’s lineup, though the Ascent shares a platform with most of them. \n\n![22. 2019 Ascent Limited](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1nUJ8TPm3wqULMADI9hARx/7e58a31d5108e6c5497404290397924b/22._2019_Ascent_Limited.jpg)\n\n\n\nAll Ascent models come with a single engine choice: a 2.4-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder horizontally opposed engine that makes 260 horsepower and 277 pound-feet of torque. This engine is paired with a CVT automatic gearbox and permanent all-wheel drive. \n\nThere are four trim levels in the Ascent family: the Base, the Premium, the Limited and the Touring. The Base and the Premium come standard with eight-passenger seating (the middle seat is a three-person bench), the Limited offers a no-charge, middle-row captain’s chair option (for seven passengers total) and the Touring comes standard with the captain’s chairs. \n\nThe Base version starts at $32,970, while the Touring starts at $45,670.\n\nThe Ascent competes against a growing class of large family crossovers that includes the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, Mazda CX-9, Dodge Durango, Volkswagen Atlas, Ford Explorer, Kia Sorento, Hyundai Santa Fe, Nissan Pathfinder and Chevy Traverse. \n\n![10 .2019 Ascent Limited](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/R7ApNJWBSbylFfqBokmVP/dce78c29d16b941a29a45d12f1b99caa/10_.2019_Ascent_Limited.jpg)\n\n---\n\n{ad}\n\n## What’s good\n*TLDR: Room for everything, safe as a safe, useful infotainment system*\n\n__Space for life.__ Subaru did an excellent job thinking through the Ascent’s interior and how owners will use it. There’s plenty of head and legroom for adults in all three rows (though the third row is a little narrow), the seats move and slide and fold out of the way easily, there are a billion cupholders (OK,19), plus a deep console bin up front for purses or laptops and bins and cubbies for everything a family would need to store onboard. \n\n![41. 2019 Ascent Limited](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/4XWuWTx0Pjk237HYSdPoSl/4bae9a24e81e11c12998360f9ed19c44/41._2019_Ascent_Limited.jpg)\n\n__Infotainment system.__ The Ascent’s in-dash touchscreen setup was bright, intuitive and performed great during our week-long test. Other systems from rivals like Honda, Mazda, Ford and Chevy couldn’t match the Subaru’s savvy combination of these three attributes.\n\n__Safety.__ Subaru garnered a coveted Top Safety Pick Plus designation from the IIHS -- the independent agency’s highest safety rating (and something none of its rivals achieved for 2019). All models come standard with Subaru’s EyeSight suite of active safety tech; it includes adaptive cruise control, pre-collision braking, lane-departure warning and lane-keep assist.\n\n\n\n## What’s bad\n*TLDR: Powertrain needs more power, noisy on the road, hiking boots styling*\n\n__Powertrain.__ Subaru is one of the few brands in this three-row crossover segment to use a turbocharged four-cylinder engine instead of a V6. Honestly, we’d prefer a V6. The Ascent turbo engine and its CVT gearbox made for an uninspired combination; we were left wanting either a real automatic transmission with gears or a V6 (or both).\n\n__Style.__ Or lack thereof. Subarus have never been great in the styling department, so the homely looks of this Ascent shouldn’t be a surprise. It’s not ugly, but it’s certainly more of a rugged hiking boot compared to the sleek, refined style of rivals like the Mazda CX-9, the Chevy Traverse or even the Honda Pilot.\n\n__Road noise.__ We generally found the Ascent’s interior to be comfy, but on freeway drives there was too much road noise seeping into the cabin for our taste. \n\n![6. 2019 Ascent Limited](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/1L48WtfLYLAwEqC2ZKHEZj/6840feee00916edc11cdad5bcb95c86a/6._2019_Ascent_Limited.jpg) \n\n---\n\n## 5 stars of execution\n\nSafety Features? __YES__\n- As we mentioned, the Ascent comes standard with an impressive suite of active safety tech. This includes adaptive cruise control, pre-collision braking, lane-departure warning and lane-keep assist. \n- All this, plus the LED projector headlights on the Limited and Touring models, netted the Ascent the rare IIHS Top Safety Pick Plus designation for 2019. This Subaru also has a five-star crash test rating from NHTSA. \n\nValue? __YES__\n- While it’s not a class-leading bargain, Subaru gives you your money’s worth on most trims of the Ascent. \n- As mentioned, the Base model starts off with an impressive suite of active safety features, all-wheel drive, seating for eight people, a 6.5-inch touchscreen infotainment system, among other features, for a reasonable $32,970. \n- Buyers then have three more trim levels beyond that, each with smart option packages that allow them to get the features they want without making the full jump to the next trim level. Each trim level and option package is smartly priced for this segment. \n\nEfficiency? __YES__\n- Thanks to its smaller turbocharged four-cylinder engine, the Ascent manages some of the best non-hybrid fuel economy in a segment dominated by thirstier V6 engines (Mazda’s CX-9 -- which also uses a turbo four -- and Toyota’s Highlander are a close second). \n- The Ascent is rated by the EPA at 21/27/23 MPG city/highway/combined; we saw about 17 MPG during our week of testing in mixed (city/highway) driving.  \n\n ![18. 2019 Ascent Limited](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5mXmGzxijbElIJIuQ6o3p5/a86165e80a7c817e66b43ab44c8c5af3/18._2019_Ascent_Limited.jpg)\n\nDriving experience? __NO__\n- This was a close call and almost a YES vote for us. But, ultimately, the Ascent’s combination of a turbo four-cylinder that can feel strained or underpowered and a CVT gearbox that exacerbated the issue pushed us into the NO column for driving experience. \n- There was also some road noise we wished would go away. \n- Otherwise, the Ascent is a fine daily driver; visibility, comfort and handling are all good.\n\nExecution? __YES__\n- Powertrain gripes aside, the Ascent is an excellent crossover and one that should be looked at by anyone seeking a three-row family hauler. \n- The execution of the interior is particularly impressive; space, comfort and functionality are all mixed nicely. And then Subaru adds in excellent safety ratings and smartly-executed trim levels. \n\n##  Total Rating: 4 stars\n\n![13. 2019 Ascent Limited](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7MSfVpdGFi2MGygr7UMiXR/87e239a757669bb7889ff908e30fa394/13._2019_Ascent_Limited.jpg) \n\n\n---\n\n## What’s it gonna cost me?\nThe __base Ascent__ starts at $32,970, including destination. \n\nIt comes standard with all-wheel drive, EyeSight active safety features, Hill Descent Control, paddle shifters, three-zone climate control, a 6.5-inch touchscreen infotainment system and eight-passenger seating. \n\nThe __Premium__ starts at $35,170 and adds to the Base model 4G LTE WiFi connectivity, power driver’s seat, heated front seats, middle-row climate control buttons, an eight-inch touchscreen for the infotainment system, blind-spot detection, rear cross-traffic alert and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. It also gives buyers the option of swapping out the middle bench seat for a second-row captain’s chairs. \n\n__The Premium is the model we would buy__, and then we’d add the (expensive but worth it) 7-Passenger Sporty Package. For $4,260, it adds the middle-row captain’s chairs, a panoramic moonroof, power liftgate, keyless entry, automatic reverse braking, 20-inch wheels and Subaru’s touchscreen navigation system. That’s a fully-loaded family hauler for a tick under $40,000. \n\nNext is the __Limited__ model. It starts at $39,970 and has basically all of the aforementioned options as standard equipment, except it subtracts the panoramic moonroof and navigation system and instead adds leather seats, heated middle-row seats, a heated steering wheel, and power front seats.__ This is also a favorite trim of ours,__ but we like the panoramic moonroof setup on the previous trim level better. \n\nFinally, the __Touring__ starts at $45,670 and adds to the Limited standard features like the panoramic moonroof, ventilated front seats, faux-wood trim, the navigation system, a 14-speaker, 792-watt Harman Kardon stereo system and a 180-degree front parking camera.\n\n---\n\n## Also consider\nThe Ascent is in one of the largest and most competitive crossover segments in the industry: the three-row, family hauler. While we recommend the Ascent, there are also several compelling rivals you should look into. \n- Our favorites include Mazda’s CX-9 (class-leading styling and handling), the Honda Pilot, the VW Atlas and the Hyundai Santa Fe XL (each is very well-rounded with few shortcomings). \n- Chevy’s Traverse has tons of room and nice styling but falls short in many other areas. \n- Toyota’s Highlander is good, but this generation is old and due for a refresh; its third-row seat is also very small. \n-   Ford’s Explorer is due to be replaced soon; the outgoing generation is too outdated in many respects. Ditto for the Dodge Durango and Nissan Pathfinder. \n\n","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Review","CUV"],"ctaText":"View Subaru Ascents for sale","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/subaru-ascent#year_min=2019\u0026year_max=2019","modified_date":"2019-04-18T21:21:29.492Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/e0O3l0qBJ7n1q5W2MSJB3/311ddca1bf09e8a19cd96ff1b88ab575/nissan_kicks_hero-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/7uGKFz3W3dtNQ9y6Wrimt/a687c661395e9ac2b55f36502a792006/nissan_kicks_thumb-image.jpg","slug":"2019-nissan-kicks-review","title":"Driven: 2019 Nissan Kicks","publication_date":"2019-01-16T15:00-08:00","content_summary":"Nissan’s new Kicks takes on a crowded field of entry-level crossovers.

This power is sent to the front wheels via a CVT gearbox (the Kicks is front-wheel-drive only, no all-wheel-drive is offered). \n\nThere are three trim levels on the Kicks: S, SV and SR. They range in price from $19,535 to $21,865.\n\n---\n## What’s good\n*TLDR: Good acceleration, great size, sips gas*\n\n__The drive.__ Ok, so don’t take it to the drag strip on the weekend, but the Kicks offers a healthy amount of acceleration from its small four-cylinder engine engine. All models come standard with 122 horsepower, which is less than nearly all of its rivals. But the only time this becomes is high in the engine’s RPMs when you’re really leaning on the gas. In normal daily driving, it was more than fine.  \n\n![2018 Nissan KICKS Interior](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/3KASPSjlrFmK77JwZTgz0t/aedda6a81ee9e1ef4e94b1a412f2c481/2018_Nissan_KICKS_Interior.jpg)\n\n__The size.__ The Kicks manages to give you the best of both worlds. It’s a small vehicle with a tight turning radius so it’s easy to park and maneuver in tight situations. BUT it promises plenty of interior space for both passengers and cargo. And unlike other vehicles in this small segment, the Kicks gives you plenty of room for tall passengers in the rear seats. That’s a crucial win-win for us. \n\n__Efficiency.__ With a small engine and a light curb weight, the Kicks manages to be one of the most fuel-efficient models in this segment, easily beating rivals from Honda, Toyota and Ford.\n\n{ad type=\"bpov\"}\n\n## What’s bad\n*TLDR: Awful steering, no AWD, funky style.*\n\n__The steering system.__ This was our biggest complaint about the Kicks: its numb and unresponsive steering system. We test hundreds of vehicles a year so we’re used to adapting to a new steering feel, but the Kicks took longer to get used to than any vehicle in recent memory. The steering always felt numb and disconnected from the front wheels and it seemed to override or ignore smaller inputs at times. So test drive the Kicks in a variety of situations to make sure you could live with it. \n\n![2018 Nissan KICKS Interior2](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/5Ma8uhjo09WpDAHZpVBxaf/55f129d2ca1922b040b14f3592c323d4/2018_Nissan_KICKS_Interior2.jpg)\n\n__No all-wheel-drive.__ Unlike some of its competitors (Chevy Trax, Ford EcoSport, Honda HR-V, Jeep Renegade) the Kicks comes only in front-wheel-drive; no all-wheel-drive option is available. This is a bummer for people in colder, snowier climates who are looking for dependable traction in their bite-sized crossover. \n\n__Exterior styling.__ We didn’t love the looks of the rear end or the Kicks’ silhouette; both seemed ungainly when compared to rivals like the Mazda CX-3. Not a deal breaker though.\n\n---\n\n## 5 stars of execution\n\nSafety Features? __YES__\n- The Kicks is rated by the independant Insurance Institute for Highway Safety as a Top Safety Pick; it has yet to be crash-tested by NHTSA.\n- All models come standard with automatic pre-collision warning and braking.\n- The SV and SR models add blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert and the SR has a 360 degree parking camera. \n\nValue? __YES__\n- Because the Kicks is in a value-conscious segment, Nissan worked hard to give it a healthy bang for your buck. \n- Regardless of which trim level you choose, there are enough amenities with each one that buyers won’t feel like they’re in a cheapo penalty box just because the opted for Nissan’s entry-level crossover. \n\nEfficiency? __YES__\n- The Kicks is rated by the EPA at 31/36/33 MPG city/highway/combined. \n- That’s significantly better than nearly every competitor the Kicks faces, including models from Toyota, Honda, Ford, Chevy and Mazda. Thanks here to the low curb weight and small engine.\n\nDriving experience? __YES__\n- With a light curb weight and good acceleration, the Kicks was an easy daily driver. \n- It also has a nice ride height and visibility from the driver’s seat, yet it’s super easy to get in and out of. \n- As we mentioned, our biggest gripe was the Kicks’ steering. Though we did eventually get used to it, we never ended up liking it. \n\n![18 Nis Kicks 04](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/705bz8ns9CdMZbbaGWHwKm/4375e6ad398b69fa1f602e2f9923bdbe/18_Nis_Kicks_04.jpg)\n\nExecution? __YES__\n- Overall Nissan did a great job with the Kicks. \n- It’s a well-rounded vehicle that does everything well; it’s comfortable, practical, safe and easy to live with every day. \n- We just wish it came in AWD too, though a good set of snow tires should make buyers in snowy climates perfectly happy. \n\n##  Total Rating: 5 stars\n\n---\n\n{ad type=\"m-box-1\"}\n{ad type=\"dt-box-breaker\"}\n\n## What’s it gonna cost me?\nAs mentioned, there are three trim levels on the Kicks. \n\n__The S__ starts at $19,535 and comes with a seven-inch touchscreen display for the infotainment system, Bluetooth connectivity, automatic emergency braking, push-button start, steering wheel-mounted controls, a backup camera and power mirrors. \n\n__The SV__ starts at $21,245 and adds to the S things like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, a seven-inch digital display in the instrument panel, blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and 17-inch alloy wheels. __This would be the model we’d opt for__ since it adds some safety tech and extra connectivity without breaking the bank. \n\nThe higher-end __Kicks SR__ starts at $21,865 and adds to the SV LED headlights, fog lights, heated outside mirrors, leather-wrapped shift knob and steering wheel, rear roof spoiler and a nifty 360-degree parking camera.\n\n![2018 Nissan KICKS Interior 3](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2woVmggQkTBtqAhDf2UAwD/10d56fa9498819babe5e2934b6a8d32c/2018_Nissan_KICKS_Interior_3.jpg)\n\n---\n\n## Also consider\nThe Kicks is in a busy class of bite-sized crossovers that’s getting more competitive with each year. While this Nissan is one of our favorites, here’s a look at how some of its peers stack up. \n\n- Our favorite in this segment is the __Honda HR-V__ for how well it manages cargo space inside. It’s also available with optional all-wheel-drive and a variety of other higher-end options that aren’t available in the Kicks. \n- __Hyundai’s Kona__ is another one of our favorites for its all-around execution. Ditto for its mechanical cousin, the __Kia Niro__.\n- Toyota’s oddball __C-HR__ is front-wheel-drive like the Kicks and it too is aimed at the more urban buyer rather than an all-around vehicle like the Honda HR-V or Jeep Renegade. It’s perfectly fine as a daily driver though rivals promise more interior space. \n- __Chevy’s Trax__ is a handsome alternative with a quiet, comfortable interior. But its fuel economy isn’t great and it’s getting a little old at this point. Still, it’s definitely worth a look. \n- Skip __Ford’s EcoSport__. It’s a model that was designed for foreign markets and then brought to the U.S. halfway through its lifespan.

This fifth-generation model is launching with a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 that makes 335 horsepower and 369 pound-feet of torque. It’s paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and Audi’s esteemed quattro all-wheel-drive system. \n\nAudi will introduce a cheaper base A6 with a turbocharged 2.0-liter, four-cylinder engine this coming summer.\n\nThe A6 comes in three trim levels currently: the Premium, the Premium Plus and the Prestige. The base model starts at $58,895 while the Prestige starts at $68,095, including destination but before options. \n\nIn the U.S., the A6 is sedan-only, though Europe gets a wagon version. Later, Audi will likely roll out the performance-oriented versions; first the S6 and then later still the RS6 should debut. The previous generation of RS6 was wagon-only and thus not destined for the U.S. market but there are rumors that the next one could land here. \n\n\n---\n\n## What’s good\n*TLDR: Gleaning interior of the future, smart switch to a turbo V6.*\n\n![Large-2019-Audi-A6-5012](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/6uN1YcufGEUGCMCA0SI4eS/1f2879d3716a0702bdb628543be18562/Large-2019-Audi-A6-5012.jpg)\n\n__The interior.__ This alone will be a key selling point for Audi’s A6. The insides of this thing are class-leading. The dashboard is highlighted by two gorgeous touchscreens with both audible and haptic feedback (you feel a light click when you touch them). They control nearly every function in the car; their layouts and menus are intuitive yet stylish and the system’s performance is fast. Audi wisely programmed in multiple ways to do the same task so rather than forcing customers to learn its system, the system will respond to the command type that the user is most comfortable with. \n\n__The engine.__ Previously, the A6’s V6 was supercharged, but the switch to a turbo means the power is available during more of the acceleration curve so the fun is too. After you get past a wee bit of turbo lag, there’s gobs of mid-range oomph. Or just keep the car in the sportiest of its five driving modes (Dynamic) and the lag disappears entirely. We liked this. A lot.\n\n--- \n\n## What’s bad\n*TLDR: Staid exterior, less-than-eager handling.*\n\n__Is that the new one?__ Audi’s designers played it safe with the A6’s exterior. Their thinking was that those buyers who want to make a bold statement will opt for the more progressive and eye-catching (yet mechanically identical) A7 four-door coupe. Still, this design is cold, uninspired and too similar to the outgoing generation for our taste. Audi missed an opportunity here to match the stellar interior with an equally impressive exterior.\n\n![Large-2019-Audi-A6-5051](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2TZswz2QYggeccQwic8Oce/b4de541eb90cc40824b7255e7f9e8675/Large-2019-Audi-A6-5051.jpg)\n\n__Less agile than some rivals.__ The A6 looks like it drives; conservatively. The handling is perfectly fine for daily driving, but we wouldn’t call it -- or the steering -- particularly engaging. Nor does the car feel light on its feel when you toss it around; a BMW 5 Series or Cadillac CTS will be more fun in this department. \n\n\n---\n\n## 5 stars of execution\n\nSafety Features? __NO__\n- All A6 models come standard pre-collision warning and pre-collision braking. Plus, it will likely get high crash-test ratings from both NHTSA and IIHS. \n- But we were disappointed that a full suite of active safety features wasn’t standard on this new generation of car. Items like adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert are standard on non-luxury models costing tens of thousands of dollars less than the A6.\n- Making matters worse is the fact that buyers of the base Premium trim can’t even add these features as options; they’re only available on the Premium Plus and Prestige models as part of a $2,750 option package.  \n\nValue? __YES__\n- No one buys a midsize German luxury sedan for the value, but Audi does a good job of including a healthy amount of content on even the base models (aforementioned lack of safety features notwithstanding). \n- All models come with the stellar two-screen dashboard setup (though the top screen is two inches wider on the top two trims), navigation, LED headlights and taillights, a panoramic moonroof, wood trim, leather seats that are heated up front and 19-inch alloy wheels. Plus the excellent turbo V6 and quattro all-wheel-drive system. \n\nEfficiency? __YES__\n- The EPA rates the 2019 Audi A6 3.0t at 22/29/25 MPG city/highway/combined.\n- That’s significantly better than comparable rivals from BMW, Mercedes and Lexus. \n\nDriving experience? __YES__\n- This was a close one for us but ultimately we gave the Audi a star here. \n- The turbo engine is excellent and offers more than enough power for the car. \n- And while the A6’s doesn’t feel as responsive or as nimble as we’d like, it’s still a competent-handling machine that will suit the needs of most shoppers in this segment. \n\n\n\nExecution? __YES__\n- Overall as an everyday midsize luxury sedan, the A6 is an excellent car. \n- Audi is clearly willing to sacrifice buyers looking for a visual statement and more fun behind the wheel in exchange for the large group of buyers who prioritize interior comfort, tech and amenities, plus a satisfying engine moving it all around. \n- The A6 smartly carves out a place for itself amongst the more dynamic BMW 5 Series and the more classic Mercedes E-Class. \n\n##  Total Rating: 4 out of 5 stars\n\n\n---\n\n## What’s it gonna cost me?\nAs we mentioned, the base A6 with the Premium trim starts at $58,895. That includes the turbo V6, quattro all-wheel-drive, navigation system, a 10-speaker, 180-watt sound system, 7-inch digital instrument panel display, two touchpads in the dashboard, LED headlights and taillights, a panoramic moonroof, wood trim, parking sensors, leather seats that are heated up front and 19-inch alloy wheels. \n\nThe Premium Plus starts at $63,695, including destination. It adds to the base model a fully digital instrument panel with a 12.3-inch customizable screen, the larger touchscreen in the dashboard, a Bang \u0026 Olufsen sound system with 16 speakers and 705 watts, a 360-degree parking camera, rear cross-traffic alerts and matrix beam headlights.\n\nFinally the Prestige model starts at $68,095. It adds to the Premium Plus features like a heads-up display, power soft-close doors, power-closing trunk, four-zone climate control, LED interior lighting and heated and cooled front seats.\n\nIf it’s our money on the line, we’d opt for either the pure base Premium model (everything you need, nothing you don’t) for $58,895 or the Premium Plus model with the Driver Assistance Package for $66,445. \n\n\n## Also consider\nThe A6 competes in a tough class of industry benchmarks so there are several great alternatives if you’re not set on the A6. BMW’s 5 Series is probably our favorite at the moment, largely for how it blends luxury and performance like no one else. \n\nThe Mercedes E Class is for the more conservative buyer; its interior is conservative compared to Audi’s tech-centric approach, but no one can match the Benz for tasteful elegance. \n\nVolvo’s S90 sedan is an understated alternative that’s worth considering. While it comes with a four-cylinder engine only and its handling prowess isn’t on par with the A6, it does offer equal levels of design, luxury and panache. Reliability is its biggest weakness currently. \n\nSkip Jaguar’s XF; while it’s a nice alternative to the Germans, reliability remains an issue. Plus, whatever you’re looking for it to do, one of the Germans can likely do it better. \n\nThe Lexus GS is old for its generation so many of its features (engine tech, interior design and amenities) won’t be on par with the A6 but it sells for less than the Audi in case you’re looking for more of a bargain. \n\n\n\n\n","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Review","Sedan"],"ctaText":"Browse Listings","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/audi-a6#year_min=2019\u0026year_max=2019","modified_date":"2019-04-18T21:23:37.677Z"},{"hero_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2DbHrrNCVO2K0uMwyEO6U6/809f574a4bcfa37c4a6365bf71ec939b/BMW330i_review_hero-image.jpg","thumb_image":"https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2FmXbkwLios06Euaqye8mQ/94aeaf65b119da091715ff74916e7b21/BMW330i_review_thumb-image.jpg","slug":"2019-bmw-330i-2020-M340i-review","title":"Driven: 2019 BMW 330i and 2020 M340i","publication_date":"2018-12-11T15:00-08:00","content_summary":"BMW’s all-new, seventh-generation 3 Series is on its way with more power, more space and more tech goodies.

It’s often called the benchmark of the sport sedan segment; BMW’s 4 Series is the coupe, four-door coupe and convertible variant, though new versions of those models haven’t been revealed yet. \n\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzWvu4VjRb8\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\"\u003eEmbedded content: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzWvu4VjRb8\u003c/a\u003e\n\nBMW’s equally-iconic M3 performance sedan will debut in another year or so. \n\nThe 3 Series competes against models like the Audi A4, Mercedes C Class, Genesis G70, Alfa Romeo Giulia, Volvo S60, Acura TLX, Lexus IS and ES, Infiniti Q50, Cadillac ATS, and Kia Stinger.\n\nThis new generation 3 Series is known internally (and to BMW fans worldwide) as the G20 model. It grows a bit versus its predecessor: the wheelbase is 1.6 inches longer, the overall length is 2.9 inches longer and it’s slightly wider and taller. Despite this growth, by using more aluminum throughout the 3 Series’ body, structure and chassis, BMW was able to shave as much as 121 pounds off the previous model’s curb weight. \n\n![P90323672 highRes the-all-new-bmw-3-se (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/2fXeqrssuY0MygQk6wgEOy/dccc433fb5c6e0c7acec1cee950626d3/P90323672_highRes_the-all-new-bmw-3-se__1_.jpg)\n\nThere will be two models of the new 3 Series initially, the 330i and the M340i. \n\nThe 330i will be a 2019 model and goes on sale in March 2019; it will start at $41,245, including destination. It’s powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline four-cylinder engine that makes 255 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque (a gain of seven horsepower and 37 pound-feet of torque versus the outgoing model. \n\nThe lustier M340i version will go on sale next summer as a 2020 model and it starts at $54,995. This model uses a turbocharged straight-six cylinder engine that makes 382 horsepower and 369 pound-feet of torque. \n\nBoth the 330i and M340i will come standard with an eight-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters and a manual mode. Rear-wheel-drive is standard on both, while BMW’s xDrive all-wheel-drive system will be a $2,000 option.\n\n---\n\n\n\n## What’s good\n*TLDR: More of everything that's made the 3 Series good.*\n\n__More of the good stuff.__ The base 330i now comes with slightly more horsepower (up seven) and more torque (37 additional pound-feet), plus more space inside and out (four six-foot-tall passengers can ride comfortably), more cutting-edge technology features, excellent handling and impressive refinement. And with no price increase versus the outgoing sixth-generation. Kudos to BMW for making the good parts of the 3 Series better without inadvertently creating new weak spots. \n\n__Tech goodies.__ A 3D, 360-degree parking camera. A drowsy driver alert system which, on command, will turn up energizing music and will use the climate control system to send pulses of cooler air into the cabin to help wake you up. A parking memory system that automatically backs the car out of the space based on how you drove it in there. BMW engineers packed a lot of novel tech-based features — most of which are optional — into this new 3 Series to keep the sedan modern, relevant and selling well in the face of increasing competition from rivals and the crossover segment. The nice thing is these features are useful and they work well -- rather than kitschy, poorly-executed novelties that no one in the real world will use. \n\n__M340i.__ While the 330i will diligently do its job as a base model with a nice mix of fun and comfort (funfort?), the M340i xDrive that we tested proved to be a real hoot on the racetrack (we weren’t able to test it on public roads). Its all-wheel-drive system ably mimics a rear-wheel-drive car with impressive levels of predictable oversteer, the powertrain has it all (strong engine power, quick transmission shifts) and the steering and handling are equal parts smooth and predictable. While the experience wasn’t as crisp as an Alfa Romeo Giulia, it was impressive and thrilling nevertheless.\n\n![P90323694 highRes the-all-new-bmw-3-se (1)](https://www.autolist.com/6tuem73u73an/74S86aDAysokqmyi64Gg2S/137dfb0b0df3c11c345672eb29c1e832/P90323694_highRes_the-all-new-bmw-3-se__1_.jpg)\n\n## What’s bad\n*TLDR: A few minor issues with its handling *\n\n__Sleepy transmission.__ When pushed hard in the 330i’s default driving mode, the eight-speed automatic feels slow to when changing gears, a marked departure from the rest of the car’s usually enthusiastic personality. \n\n__Suspension.__ Without getting into the boring details, there were times when the suspension felt too stiff (over some odd bumps in regular driving) or too bouncy (on undulating freeways) or even a little unsettled when soaking up a bump in the middle of a high-speed corner. Much of this is likely tied to a new suspension design BMW debuted on this 3 Series called lift-related damper control. Regardless of what you call it, we were surprised to encounter these issues, given BMW’s reputation for dynamic excellence. \n\n__Light steering. __In the 330i’s default mode, the steering feel was too light to provide meaningful feedback to the driver. Fortunately this was easily resolved by switching the car into one of its other modes: Sport, Sport+ (if equipped) or individual. \n\n\n---\n\n## 5 stars of execution\n\nSafety Features? __Yes__\n- All new 3 Series models come standard with the kinds of active safety features that all buyers should expect. These include pre-collision warning and braking, adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning.\n- Neither the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) or the independent Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) has released crash-test ratings for the new 3 Series.\n- However, NHTSA gave the previous-generation 3 Series a five-star crash test rating and IIHS rated it a Top Safety Pick; it’s likely the new model will have similar, if not better ratings.\n\nValue? __Yes__\n- Kudos to BMW for launching a completely redesigned model while keeping the starting price of the new 330i identical as the outgoing model ($41,245). For that money, buyers get a nice amount of stuff: the aforementioned active safety features, power moonroof, 18-inch alloy wheels, power front seats, climate control and faux-leather seats. \n\nEfficiency? __N/A__\n- The EPA hasn’t yet finalized fuel efficiency numbers for the 330i or the M340i. We’ll update this section when they do. \n- The new models are expected to be more efficient than their predecessors.\n\n\nDriving experience? __Yes__\n- Despite growing in size and adding in new layers of safety tech, this BMW 330i can still boogie. It’s able to give the driver plenty of feedback, thrills and comfort all at the same time (light steering and sleepy gear changes notwithstanding). \n- The six-cylinder M340i version takes all this and dials it up several notches while ironing out most of the issues we didn’t like on the 330i. \n- It’s worth mentioning, however, that this car doesn’t feel like the 3 Series models of yore: the hallowed E30, E36, or even E46 models from decades past. Nor should it or could it. Complaining about this is silly and ignorant since it ignores the realities of what the modern sport sedan buyer wants and it ignores the many global safety and efficiency standard automakers must comply with. If you’re going to gripe about this, put your money where your mouth is and buy a BMW M2 coupe or an Alfa Romeo Giulia. \n\n\nExecution? __Yes__\n- What we loved most about this new 3 Series is the way it’s able to give nearly everyone a lot to like. Your average Joe who wants a reasonably-priced luxury sport sedan that is comfortable, stylish and well-made sedan (many of the actual buyers in this segment) will be plenty happy. The buyer looking for more grin-inducing thrills than your average sport sedan provides, will be equally happy, provided they’re willing to foot the bill for the M340i. The only unhappy people will be the ones with unrealistic expectations. \n- Overall this is an excellent sport sedan that should do well to claw back some sales from the ever-growing crossover threat. \n\n##  Total Rating: 5 stars*\n\n---\n\n## What’s it gonna cost me?\nAs mentioned, the incoming 2019 __330i__ has the same base price as the outgoing 2018 model ($41,245, including destination). That model includes the 255-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder engine, LED headlights, adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist, moonroof, 18-inch alloy wheels, power front seats, smartphone unlocking for the vehicle, an 8.8-inch touchscreen infotainment system, a 5.7-inch digital display screen in the instrument panel, climate control and faux-leather seats. \n\nThe 2020 __M340i__ starts at $54,995 and comes with its stellar 382-horsepower, turbocharged inline six-cylinder engine. Its list of standard features hasn’t been finalized but it will certainly include at least the same base features as the 330i. It will also come standard with a standard limited-slip differential, navigation system, a firmer, sport-tuned M-Sport suspension that rides 0.4-inches lower, variable ratio sport steering, larger performance M Sport brakes, three-zone climate control, a 12.3-inch digital, configurable instrument panel and a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system.\n\nAll-wheel-drive is a $2,000 option on both the 330i and the M340i. \n\n---\n## Also consider\nDespite plenty of models competing against it, the 3 Series doesn’t have many true rivals who balance comfort, performance and luxury so well. \n\nAlfa Romeo’s Giulia is still a better-handling sedan, though it’s smaller and its reliability ratings aren’t great. \n\nThe Genesis G70 is another model that tops this segment in terms of handling and it's overall an excellent option but we'd still prefer this new 3 Series. \n\nThe Mercedes C Class has plenty of luxury but it's also more focused on low-key elegance than being fun on the streets. \n\nAudi's A4 is perfectly suited to many buyers' tastes but we also found it a little bland to drive.\n\n\n","locale":"en","indexed":true,"tags":["Review","Sedan"],"ctaText":"View BMW 3 Series for Sale","ctaURL":"https://www.autolist.com/bmw-3+series#year_min=2019\u0026year_max=2019","modified_date":"2019-04-18T21:24:20.359Z"}],"comparisonsSummaries":[{"slug":"toyota-highlander-vs-nissan-pathfinder","title":"Toyota Highlander vs Nissan Pathfinder","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"--- \n\n## What’s better about the Highlander?\n\n__Safety advantage.__ The Highlander has several advantages going it in the safety department: it’s rated a Top Safety Pick by the independent Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (the Pathfinder doesn’t have such a rating) AND all trims of the Highlander come standard with lane-departure warning and lane-keep assist.\n\n__Hybrid availability.__ The Highlander is one of the only crossovers in its class to offer an optional hybrid powertrain.

Yes, the Explorer has more interior space -- a crucial consideration for crossover shoppers -- and we liked the Explorer’s engine lineup more.

The Honda’s can get confusing.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n## What’s better about the CR-V?\n\n__More power.__ Nearly all trim levels of the CR-V come with a 190-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder engine (except for the base LX trim). The Nissan Rogue’s non-turbo four-cylinder has just 170 horsepower, a meaningful deficit compared to the Honda.\n\n__Space.__ While the CR-V and the Rogue have the same cargo space with the rear seats up, the Honda has a bit more when they’re folded. And the Honda has more rear legroom and headroom, things that keep the whole family happy on trips of any length.\n\n__Refinement.__ This generation of CR-V is built on a platform that it shares with the Honda Civic and Accord and it’s a good one. It’s quiet, spacious and comfortable and gives the CR-V a high-end feel compared to the rest of the segment. While the Rogue isn’t bad, it’s par for the course and not extra-ordinary like the CR-V. \n\n__Safety.__ In 2018, the NHTSA gave the Honda five-stars for its safety ratings while the Rogue only got four stars. (It’s worth noting that the IIHS gave both models a Top Safety Pick designation for 2018). \n\n\n---\n\n## Autolist’s take: \nThe Rogue is Nissan’s most popular vehicle by a wide margin (and it also outsells the Honda CR-V). It’s handsome, well-designed and practical. But so is Honda’s CR-V. And the CR-V adds an extra level of refinement, driving dynamics and safety. So for that reason, we say __Buy the CR-V. __\n\n","categories":[{"name":"Comparisons","description":"Comparisons"}],"meta_grade_source_count":7,"publication_date":"2019-01-17T00:00-08:00"},{"slug":"2015-honda-civic-vs-2015-toyota-corolla","title":"2015 Honda Civic vs. 2015 Toyota Corolla","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"## What’s better about the Civic?\n\n__Better handling.__ Not only does the Civic have a touch more horsepower (143 versus the Corolla’s 132) but reviewers generally found it more fun to drive. The Corolla’s handling was deemed “mushy” and not as sharp as the Civic’s. \n\n__Safety.__ While the Corolla is certainly a safe car, the 2015 Civic was named a Top Safety Pick by the independant Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. That’s a nice little bonus. \nCoupe or sedan? With the Corolla, you don’t have a choice, since the car is sedan-only. But Honda has long offered the Civic in both coupe and sedan variants, giving buyers more choice in how they want their small car. \n\n__More efficient.__ Despite the 2015 Civic being at the end of its lifespan, the car still beats the newer Corolla in efficiency. The EPA rates the Honda at 29/37/32 MPG city/highway/combined, compared to the Corolla’s rating of 31/28/36 MPG. \n\n## What’s better about the Corolla?\n\n__It’s a newer generation.__ This version of the Corolla debuted in the 2014 model year. Meanwhile, the 2015 Honda Civic the last year for this generation -- which debuted in 2012. This means the Corolla is generally a bit more modern and will offer better comfort and features. \n\n__More room.__ The 2015 Corolla offers more interior space for passengers as well as more cargo room in the trunk. \n\n__Better styling.__ In addition to the Corolla’s freshness giving it a more modern overall approach, we found the styling of the Corolla -- inside and out -- to be more current and better-executed than the aging Civic. \n \n## Autolist’s take: \nThis is as close to a tie as you can get. The 2015 Civic is older but it’s aged well, beating the fresher 2015 Corolla in safety ratings, handling, efficiency and body style choices. It’s a great pick for your next car. The Corolla meanwhile, is newer -- and that brings with it benefits like more modern features, comfort levels and style. Plus it’s larger inside for both people and cargo. Both models are a great choice, but if forced to choose, we’re swayed by the comfort and style of the Toyota so we say __Buy the Corolla.__  ","categories":[{"name":"Comparisons","description":"Comparisons"}],"meta_grade_source_count":10,"publication_date":"2018-09-14T00:00-07:00"},{"slug":"chevy-tahoe-versus-chevy-suburban","title":"Chevy Tahoe versus Chevy Suburban","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"---\n\n## The matchup: \nThe Tahoe and the Suburban are virtually the same vehicle, with the Suburban’s extra length (both overall and wheelbase) means more space inside. Mechanically, they’re identical, offering either a 5.3-liter V8 with 355 horsepower and 383 pound-feet of torque or an optional 6.2-liter V8 with 420 horsepower and 460 pound-feet of torque. A six-speed automatic and rear-wheel-drive are standard and a ten-speed automatic and four-wheel-drive are individually available. \n\n---\n\n## What’s better about the 2019 Tahoe?\n__It’s cheaper.__ A base Tahoe LS with the 5.3-liter V8 and rear-wheel-drive starts at $49,195 while the same Suburban model starts at $51,895. The features, comfort, style and capabilities on the two are the same, so you’re spending that extra cash on basically just more space. \n\n__Easier to live with.__ The Tahoe is just under two feet shorter in length than the Suburban. This makes it easier to park, maneuver in parking lots and just generally drive around on a daily basis. This might not seem like a big deal on paper, but since the Suburban is one of the longest vehicles on the market today, that length could become a hassle after a while. \n\n__More towing.__ This may seem counter intuitive since the Suburban is the larger of the two SUVs, but it’s the Tahoe that actually packs more towing capacity. When comparing all the various combinations of the identical powertrains (either the 5.3-liter V8 or the 6.2-liter V8 and rear-wheel-drive or four-wheel-drive), the Tahoe always comes out ahead in pounds it can tow. Usually it’s a 300 or 400-pound advantage (the Suburban ranges between 7,900-8,300 lbs and the Tahoe ranges between 8,100-8,600 lbs.). \n\n---\n\n## What’s better about the 2019 Suburban?\n\n__Space.__ While passenger room in the first two rows of seats is the same for both the Tahoe and the Suburban, it’s the third row of seats and beyond where the Suburban really shines. The third row of seats has ten inches of extra legroom versus the Tahoe’s third row (34.5 inches versus 24.8 inches). What’s more, the cargo space behind the third row has 39.3 cubic feet of space in the Suburban and only 15.3 cubic feet in the Tahoe. \n\n__Fuel efficiency is a wash.__ Despite being longer and several hundred pound heavier than the smaller Tahoe, the Suburban gets the same fuel economy ratings from the EPA on most models and configurations. This is effectively a win for the Suburban. So if you’re on the fence between the two, don’t let fuel costs or efficiency play a role. \n\n---\n\n## Autolist’s take: \nThe Suburban is an excellent — large — family hauler with more than enough room for anything life throws at you. But unless you’re ok with its massive footprint and you need its expansive cargo space regularly, it might be overkill for many buyers. The Tahoe can do nearly everything the Suburban can — haul people and cargo comfortably AND it has a higher towing capacity and costs less. So this is an easy one for us; we say __Buy the Tahoe.__\n\n---\n\n\n","categories":[],"meta_grade_source_count":12,"publication_date":"2019-03-04T00:00-07:00"},{"slug":"honda-civic-vs-toyota-corolla","title":"Honda Civic vs Toyota Corolla","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"--- \n\n## What’s better about the Honda?\n\n__More power.__ The Civic comes with one of two engines and both have considerably more power than their counterparts in the Corolla. The base engine in the Civic is a 158-horsepower four-cylinder, which overshadows the 132 horsepower in most Corolla models (the Corolla LE Eco has 140 horsepower). The top three trims (out of five) on the Civic come with a 174-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder that the Corolla can’t match.\n\n__Better performer.__ In addition to a more powerful engine lineup, the Civic also trumps the Corolla in terms of driving excitement. Reviewers have praised the eagerness and smoothness of the Civic whereas the Corolla is generally regarded as far more dull to drive. Plus, the Civic can also be had in the performance-oriented Sport trim and the ultra-fast, 306-horsepower Type R. \n\n__Greener.__ The Civic lineup boasts better fuel economy across the board than the Corolla. The base Civic is rated at 31/40/34 MPG city/highway/combined versus the Corolla’s 28/36/32 MPG rating. Even the turbocharged Civic models beat the Corolla thanks to a 32/42/36 MPG rating.\n\n---\n\n## What’s better about the Toyota?\n\n__Better reliability.__ Consumer Reports not only gives the Corolla its coveted “Recommended” rating but it also rates the Corolla as a 5/5 for reliability; the Civic only gets a 3/5 – and no “Recommended” rating either. \n\n__Better safety features.__ All models of the 2018 Corolla sedan come standard with active safety features like pre-collision warning and braking, lane-departure warning and prevention and adaptive cruise control. Many of these features are optional on the Civic, but they don’t come standard, save for the loaded Touring trim. \n\n---\n\n## Autolist’s take:\nYou really can’t go wrong here. The Toyota Corolla has a better track record of reliability plus impressive standard safety features for an economy car. The Civic, meanwhile, has a better engine lineup, better efficiency and promises more fun in daily driving. If we were forced to pick between the two, we’re swayed by fun plus efficiency, so we say __Buy the Civic.__ \n\n---","categories":[],"meta_grade_source_count":9,"publication_date":"2018-10-19T00:00-07:00"},{"slug":"2018-honda-hrv-versus-2018-honda-crv","title":"2018 Honda HR-V vs. 2018 Honda CR-V","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"\n## What’s better about the CR-V?\n\n__More interior space. __You don’t need a calculator to understand how this helps -- if you need the space. The CR-V EX has 102.9 cubic feet of passenger space while the HR-V EX has 96.1 cubic feet of passenger space. The larger CR-V has about 20 extra cubic feet of cargo space with the seats folded than the HR-V does with its seats folded. \n\n__Fuel economy.__ Ok, it’s not better on the CR-V but it’s the same as the smaller HR-V. When you consider that the CR-V is a larger vehicle we count that as a win. \n\n___\n\n## What’s better about the HR-V?\n\n\n__Parking and maneuverability.__ Because it’s smaller than the CR-V, living with it on a daily basis -- street parking, navigating tight parking lots or general city driving -- is arguably easier in the HR-V. This is because it’s about ten inches shorter than the CR-V.\n\n__It’s cheaper.__ The HR-V is Honda’s smallest CUV and its entry-level model. When new, the HR-V starts at about $3,700 cheaper than the CR-V. This means you could either add more options to your HR-V to make up the difference, buy a new HR-V rather than a used CR-V or just pocket the difference. Good choices all around. \n\n___\n\n## Autolist’s take:\nThere’s no bad choice here since both of these vehicles come with Honda’s rock-solid reliability and a healthy dose of practicality no matter their size. We like the HR-V for just how versatile and useful the interior is, regardless of the tidy packaging outside. And that small footprint makes it super easy to live with in urban settings. Meanwhile, the equally functional 2018 CR-V adds on a healthy dose of refinement and comfort -- two things the HR-V can’t match -- while still being easy to live with (parking included) on a daily basis.

The all-wheel-drive Rogue is rated by the EPA at 25/32/27 MPG city/highway/combined, while the all-wheel-drive Murano is 21/28/24 MPG city/highway/combined. \n\n__It’s cheaper.__ The advantage of the Rogue being positioned down the ladder from the Murano is it’s cheaper. Currently, a new Rogue starts at around $25,795 for a base S front-wheel-drive model. The cheapest Murano is the S front-wheel-drive version and it starts at $32,045, a cool $6,250 more than the Rogue. \n\n__Better styling.__ The Rogue is a handsome crossover, mixing strength and style into a compelling package — something many of its more staid rivals can’t do. The Murano, meanwhile, is a little odd-looking to many people. While we personally like the expressive, dramatic styling of the Murano, many don’t, which could hurt your resale value in the long run.\n\n__Third row.__ Unlike the Murano, the Rogue can be equipped with a third-row seat. Though it’s tight on space and you probably wouldn’t put adults back there, having the option in case you pull last-minute carpool duty to soccer practice is a nice touch \n\n\n---\n\n## What’s better about the Murano?\n\n__More luxury.__ The Murano is positioned higher in Nissan’s crossover lineup than the Rogue. This means that while it does cost more than the Rogue, the Murano also offers a higher level of refinement, amenities, comfort and style. \n\n__More power.__ Since the Murano is a higher-tier segment of vehicle than the Rogue, it naturally has a larger, more powerful engine. The Murano has a 3.5-liter V6 that makes 260 horsepower and 240 pound-feet of torque. The Rogue, meanwhile, has a 2.5-liter four-cylinder that makes 170 horsepower and 175 pound-feet of torque. \n\n__More space.__ The Murano offers more cargo room both with the rear seats upright and with them folded than the Rogue does. It also offers more legroom and headroom in the second row than the Rogue. \n\n\n---\n\n## Autolist’s take: \nThe Rogue is easily the most popular vehicle Nissan sells each year and with its sharp styling, useful interior and smart pricing, we can see why. But the Murano is a cut above the Rogue in terms of style (at least we think so), comfort, refinement and power. Yes it costs more, but to us that’s a tradeoff we’re willing to make — particularly in the used market where it’s likely you could find one to fit your budget. So we say __Buy the Murano.__\n\n","categories":[{"name":"Comparisons","description":"Comparisons"}],"meta_grade_source_count":9,"publication_date":"2019-02-27T00:00-08:00"},{"slug":"nissan-altima-vs-ford-fusion","title":"Nissan Altima vs Ford Fusion","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"---\n\n## What’s better about the Altima? \n\n__Better safety features.__ All versions of the 2018 Altima come standard with active safety features like forward collision warning and pre-collision braking on both surface streets around town and the highway. These features are optional on the Fusion (though it’s worth noting that the Fusion makes lane departure warning and prevention an option whereas the Altima doesn’t even offer them). \n\n__Fuel economy.__ This generation of Nissan’s four-cylinder Altima has killer fuel economy, something none of the non-hybrid Ford models can touch. The four-cylinder Altima is rated at 27/38/31 MPG city/highway/combined. The best the non-hybrid Fusion can muster is 24/36/28. \n\n---\n\n## What’s better about the Fusion? \n\n__More powertrain choices.__ The Ford Fusion offers a wide variety of engine and powertrain options. Plug-in hybrid? This Ford’s got one. Base four-cylinder gas engine? Yep. Turbocharged engines? The Fusion has two four-cylinder EcoBoost turbos to choose from, and one six-cylinder EcoBoost turbo, for a maximum of 325 horsepower. The Altima, meanwhile, has just a base (non-turbo) four-cylinder and an optional 270-horsepower V6. \n\n__All-wheel-drive.__ The Fusion is one of the few midsize family sedans to offer optional all-wheel-drive (most models come standard with front-wheel-drive). The Altima is front-whee-drive only. This matters to some owners in cold climates where traction is essential.\n\n__Better infotainment.__ The Fusion comes with Ford’s Sync 3 infotainment system, the latest in the automaker’s line of software. It’s considered to be faster and more modern than the aging system in the Altima. \n\n---\n\n## Autolist’s take: \nIt’s worth noting that both of these sedans are at the end of their lifecycles; the Altima is all-new for 2019 while the Fusion will be around for another year before being discontinued in 2020. Rivals like the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Chevrolet Malibu, Hyundai Sonata and Kia Optima are all more modern in 2018. But if you’re choosing between this Fusion and Altima, we like the Fusion more.

But only the Colorado offers a second engine option: a fuel-efficient diesel that also boasts impressive towing abilities. Plus, the Chevy engines have more power and torque than their Toyota counterparts.\n\n__Speaking of towing,__ the Colorado wins here too. While both the Chevy and Toyota four-cylinder models can tow 3,500 pounds, the V6 Colorado tops out at 7,000 pounds while the V6 Tacoma tops out at 6,500 pounds. Need more grunt? As mentioned, the Chevy offers a diesel engine option that can tow up to 7,700 pounds.\n\n__Interior space.__ The Chevy offers noticeably more headroom and legroom in both its Extended Cab and larger Crew Cab configurations than the corresponding Tacoma Access Cab and Double Cab models.\n\n---\n \n## What’s better about the Tacoma?\n\n__Resale value.__ Thanks to years of proven reliability and toughness, the Tacoma has earned a loyal following. This means there are plenty of people willing to pay top dollar for a used Tacoma, even if it has more than 100,000 miles. This may not be an advantage if you’re looking to buy a used Tacoma but know that when you go to sell yours, your investment will have paid off.\n\n__Safety.__ Toyota offers some key safety gear as standard equipment on its 2018 Tacoma. This includes pre-collision braking and warning and lane-departure warning. These features are optional on the Colorado – if they’re offered at all.\n\n__Reliability.__ Since this is a Toyota, it has a long history of excellent reliability standing behind it. Not that the Colorado has known areas of concern, but if we’re choosing one of these two trucks solely on how long it will last, our bet is on the Tacoma.\n \n---\n \n## Autolist’s take: \nThis is a tough call. Both the Chevy Colorado and the Toyota Tacoma bring a lot to the table. The Chevy brings with it more capability (power, towing and interior space) plus is has the optional diesel engine that the Toyota can’t match. You’d be wise to choose the Colorado for these reasons alone and never look back. But the Tacoma is still plenty capable in its own right.

So not only will the RAV4 hold more, its slightly smaller size will be easier to park. \n\n__Reliable.__ Toyota has a long history of being one of the most -- if not the most -- reliable brands on the market. Consumer Reports backs this up by not only finding the RAV4’s reliability to be a 5/5 versus the Rogue’s 3/5, but also by giving the RAV4 a coveted ‘Recommended’ rating, which is doesn’t bestow on the Rogue. \n\n__Better safety rating.__ The RAV4 has a five-star safety rating by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; the Rogue only has a four-star rating. However, both models have a Top Safety Pick designation from the independent IIHS. \n\n\n\n___\n\n## What’s better about the Nissan Rogue?\n\n__More efficient.__ Whether it’s a front-wheel-drive model, an all-wheel-drive version or the hybrid, each iteration of the Rogue easily beat the RAV4 for fuel efficiency. That’s the gift that keeps on giving since it will save you money throughout your entire ownership of the Nissan. \n\n__It’s newer.__ This generation of the Rogue has been around since the 2014 model year, while the 2018 RAV4 is the last year of its generation before an all-new model bows for 2019. This means the Rogue will generally be a little more modern in its style, design, construction and execution. \n\n__Style.__ This one is subjective, but we think the Rogue is better-looking inside and out than the RAV4. Its exterior design is more sophisticated than the sharply-angled look on the RAV4, and inside the Rogue is a simpler, more straightforward setup. \n\n\n___\n\n## Autolist’s take:\nThere’s a reason each of these crossover are the best selling model from Toyota and Nissan respectively: they’re both excellent, so you can’t go wrong with either. The Rogue is the more stylish of the two, offers better efficiency and is a touch newer than this generation of RAV4. But the Toyota has a better safety rating, better reliability and more space.

This can be a big deal for buyers in colder climates dealing with slippery roads in the winter. \n\n__Room.__ Despite being about two inches shorter overall than the Toyota C-HR, the Honda HR-V is a marvel of packaging. Inside, the Honda boasts considerably more passenger space and cargo space than the Toyota.

This gives the Ford Explorer a distinct advantage. \n\n---\n\n## Autolist’s take: \nThis is a tough one. The Explorer is better for buyers who need a lot of space, particularly three rows of seats for carpooling or plenty of cargo room. Meanwhile the Jeep is the better choice for those who will be towing large loads. But what if you’re not in either of those camps and you’re just looking for a large crossover for everyday use? While the Ford Explorer has a nice range of optional turbocharged engines and better reliability, we’re smitten with the refinement, style and build quality of the Jeep so we say __Buy the Jeep.__","categories":[{"name":"Comparisons","description":"Comparisons"}],"meta_grade_source_count":13,"publication_date":"2019-01-31T00:00-07:00"},{"slug":"2015-chevrolet-camaro-vs-2015-dodge-challenger","title":"2015 Chevrolet Camaro vs. 2015 Dodge Challenger","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"## What’s better about the Camaro?\n\n__ Power.__ Whether you choose the base V6 engine, mid-level V8 or optional V8, the Camaro tops the corresponding Challenger for horsepower with the exception of the bonkers Challenger Hellcat model. The Chevy’s V6 has 323 horsepower versus the Dodge V6’s 305 horsepower, the Chevy’s SS 6.2-liter V8 makes 426 horsepower compared to the 375 horsepower in the 5.7-liter HEMI V8 in the Dodge and the supercharged Camaro ZL1 packs 505 horsepower compared to the Challenger 392 model’s 485 horsepower.\n \n__Convertible.__ Buyers looking for the one-two punch of a muscle car that’s also a convertible don’t have such an option with the Challenger – but they do with the Camaro. Three of them actually: the base V6, SS V8 model and LT1 supercharged V8 models all come in either coupe or convertible form.\n \n \n__It can turn.__ While Camaro drivers won’t be able to carve canyons like Porsche 911 drivers (though some have tried) numerous reviews found the Chevy to be far better at turning and handling than the heavier, more cumbersome Dodge Challenger. If the roads you want to drive fast have any sort of turns, consider this.\n \n \n## What’s better about the Challenger?\n \n__You can see out of it.__ While the Challenger won’t have the outward visibility of a minivan, it’s definitely better than the Camaro – which has some of the worst outward sightlines of any car currently on the market. This is why you test-drive cars – to make sure you know what you’re signing up for.\n \n \n__Hellcat.__ The Challenger’s ace in the hole for the horsepower wars is the truly wild Hellcat model. Using a 6.2-liter supercharged V8 engine, the Hellcat makes 707 horsepower and 650 pound-feet of torque. Nothing in the Camaro family comes close to those numbers.\n \n \n__It’s bigger.__ This is a bad thing in terms of curb weight but a very good thing in terms of cabin space and trunk space. If you’re looking for everyday livability and comfort in addition to the thrills a muscle car provides, know that the Challenger has considerably more room for you (cabin) and your things (trunk) than the Camaro.\n \n \n__Better safety features.__ The Challenger offers a host of modern active safety features including pre-collision warning, adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-path detection. These aren’t offered on the 2015 Camaro.\n \n \n \n## Autolist’s take:\nThis one will come down to personal preference: which one do buyers feel most comfortable driving and owning on a daily basis? Neither of these is an agile sports car; though they have muscle car heritage, think of them as large, performance-oriented grand touring coupes. If you prioritize handling, choose the Camaro since it offers more power in its engines (except against the Hellcat) and better handling. But we’ve found the Challenger to be more comfortable to live with on a daily basis; its space and approachability go a long way. So we say __Buy the Challenger.__\n","categories":[],"meta_grade_source_count":13,"publication_date":"2018-09-20T12:01-07:00"},{"slug":"ram-1500-vs-ford-f150","title":"Ram 1500 vs. Ford F-150","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"---\n## What’s better about the Ram?\n\n__It’s cheaper.__ Because this model year is the last of this generation (the 2019 Ram is all-new), you’re more likely to get a deal on the Ram 1500 than the Ford. Full-size trucks today are getting expensive, so this could be a smart way to park a new pickup in your driveway without breaking your budget. \n\n__Better infotainment.__ Lost in all of the comparisons of engines and capabilities is the feature you’re going to look at and touch every day: the dashboard infotainment system. While Ford’s Sync 3.0 system is an improvement over earlier versions, Ram’s UConnect system is definitely better. The screen is more responsive, the menus are more intuitive and the system’s performance just feels faster. \n\n__Ride quality.__ Lower-end models of the Ram come with a perfectly fine coil spring suspension but it’s the air suspension on the higher-trim models that really stands out. It’s smooth, comfortable and lets drivers raise or lower the truck’s ride height when needed. This is a nice feature to have in any vehicle, but it’s especially appreciated in a truck like this. \n\n\n \n---\n\n## What’s better about the Ford?\n\n__It’s newer.__ This generation of F150 has been around since the 2015 model year while the Ram has been with us since the 2009 model year (an all-new generation Ram debuted in 2019). This means many features of the Ford -- including safety tech and crash test ratings, interior amenities and powertrain options -- will be more modern than the Ram. This adds up quickly. \n\n__Engines galore.__ The F150 offers a wide range of engines in the 2018 model. While the base engine is a 3.3-liter V6, a number of choices are optional, including a 2.7-liter turbo V6, a 3.5-liter turbo V6, a 5.0-liter V8 and a 3.3-liter turbodiesel V6 -- not to mention the 450-horsepower turbo V6 in the Raptor model. The Ram, meanwhile, offers just a base 3.6-liter V6, a 5.7-liter V8 and an excellent 3.0-liter turbodiesel V6. While the Ram engines are all excellent, the Ford’s broader lineup makes it more likely to choose the specific engine for your needs (our favorite is the 2.7-liter turbo V6). \n\n__Capability.__ For buyers looking to wring functionality out of their full-size truck, the Ford has an edge here. Both the base V6 F-150 and models with the high-end 3.5-liter EcoBoost engine offer better towing and better payload than the corresponding engine in the Ram.  \n\n \n---\n\n## Autolist’s take:\nRam’s 1500 is handsome, comfortable and offers a nice degree of functionality with its UConnect infotainment system. But since it’s the last year of the generation, it’s showing its age. Meanwhile, Ford’s F-150 is tops where it matters: it’s safer, offers a wider range of engines and it more capable when it comes to payload and towing -- two of the most important metrics for any pickup. So this is an easy one: we say __Buy the Ford.__ \n\n---\n","categories":[],"meta_grade_source_count":12,"publication_date":"2019-02-01T00:00-07:00"},{"slug":"2018-nissan-altima-vs-2018-toyota-camry","title":"2018 Nissan Altima vs. 2018 Toyota Camry","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"## What’s better about the Altima?\n\n__It’s cheaper.__ Because the Camry is a new generation and the 2018 Altima has been around for a while, expect to find better deals on this Nissan than the Camry.\n\n__Interior space.__  The Altima has more headroom than the Camry and more legroom in the front seats than the Camry. Though their total passenger space and trunk space is about the same, this extra room for tall people in the Nissan could be important. \n\n## What’s better about the Camry?\n\n__It’s newer.__ Toyota’s Camry was an all-new generation for 2018 (the eighth generation overall). Meanwhile, this generation of Altima hasn’t been substantially redesigned since 2013 (the 2019 Altima is all-new). Because the Camry is a newer generation, it will generally feature more modern amenities, safety features and powertrains.\n\n__More power.__ Both the base four-cylinder Camry and the optional V6 model have more horsepower and torque than the four-cylinder Altima (2.5) and optional V6 Altima (3.5), respectively. \n\n__Efficient.__ Camrys with the four-cylinder engine have a nice fuel economy advantage over the Altima with the four-cylinder engine. The Toyota is rated at 29/41/34 MPG city/highway/combined, while the Altima is rated at 27/38/31 MPG city/highway/combined. PLUS the Camry can be had with an optional hybrid powertrain while the Altima cannot.\n\n## Autolist’s take:\nThere’s nothing inherently wrong with the 2018 Nissan Altima; it handles well and it’s comfortable, safe and efficient. But because the 2018 Camry is at the beginning of its generation’s lifecycle and the 2018 Altima is at the end of its generation’s lifecycle, the Camry is simply better all around. Unless you find a huge price difference between an identical Altima and Camry, we say __Buy the Camry.__ ","categories":[{"name":"Comparisons","description":"Comparisons"}],"meta_grade_source_count":13,"publication_date":"2018-09-14T00:00-07:00"},{"slug":"vw-gti-versus-ford-focus-st","title":"VW GTI vs. Ford Focus ST","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"---\n\n## On paper: \nThe VW Golf GTI and the Ford Focus ST both belong to a segment of small cars often referred to as ‘hot hatches.’ As the name implies, their compact hatchback cars (with two or four doors) aimed at enthusiast drivers. Both models are based on more pedestrian cars but have been upgrades with more powerful engines, slicker transmissions, sharper suspensions and a variety of other changes to make life more fun in your daily drive. The Focus ST is the more visually loud of the two, both inside and out so older buyers looking for more subdued fun may be more inclined to check out the VW. \n\n---\n\n## What’s better about the VW?\n__More refined.__ VWs have long offered a higher level of refinement and sophistication than their non-luxury peers; the GTI (and the Golf it’s based on) carries on this tradition with aplomb. Its build quality, interior materials and design and road and wind noise are superior to those of the Ford Focus — and indeed all other models in the hot-hatch segment. This means you can have your fun and refined comfort in the same package. \n\n__Transmission options.__ Since many buyers of these hot-hatches prefer to row their own gears with a manual transmission, both models come standard with a six-speed manual transmission. But the GTI is the only one of these two cars to then offer an optional seven-speed dual-clutch transmission that can quicken acceleration times and make life easier in daily driving (particularly in traffic). \n\n__More space inside.__ The numbers are close but the GTI manages to edge out the Focus ST in nearly every interior dimension including headroom, legroom and cargo space (the latter is the GTI’s biggest advantage). Again, the GTI’s advantage isn’t huge but it is meaningful, so if you’re looking to wring maximum capacity out of your small car, the GTI wins here. \n\n__More efficient.__ While the Focus ST packs more power, the GTI makes up for this with better fuel economy. The VW (with the six-speed manual) is rated at 24/32/27 MPG city/highway/combined while the Focus ST clocks in at 22/30/25 MPG city/highway/combined. \n\n__Safety tech.__ The GTI is available with active safety tech like automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warning, lane-keep assist and blind-spot detection. While they’re all optional on the base GTI S, they’re not even offered on the Focus. \n\n---\n\n## What’s better about the Focus ST?\n__More power.__ The turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine in the Ford makes 252 horsepower and 270 pound-feet of torque while the same size engine in the GTI makes 220 horsepower and 259 pound-feet of torque. This is a key advantage for the Ford since a majority of buyers in this segment covet as much power as they can. \n\n__It’s cheaper.__ A base Focus ST without any options starts at $26,045. A base GTI, meanwhile, starts at $28,490, a cool $2,445 more. To sweeten the deal, remember that the Focus has 32 more horsepower. Even better? Ford is discontinuing the Focus (and its ST variant) after 2018 so savvy shoppers should be able to find dealers willing to cut the ST’s price even further. \n\n__Better handling.__ While it’s a subjective call, the more powerful Focus ST is generally regarded as the more raw, engaging hatch compared to the more subdued (and less-powerful) GTI. This will matter less to some buyers who are looking for a more rounded package, but for those who prioritize thrills and fun, the Focus is the better choice. \n\n---\n\n## Autolist’s take: \nThe Focus ST has a great reputation for grin-inducing thrills at an ultra-competitive price point. But for buyers looking for something a little more subdued but at the same time an impressive mix of fun, refinement, style, safety, comfort and efficiency, the GTI is hard to beat. Plus it’s a regular on top-ten lists of enthusiast magazines and websites. So this is an easy one for us, we say __Buy the GTI.__ \n\n---\n","categories":[{"name":"Comparisons","description":"Comparisons"}],"meta_grade_source_count":8,"publication_date":"2019-03-04T00:00-07:00"},{"slug":"nissan-pathfinder-vs-honda-pilot","title":"Nissan Pathfinder vs. Honda Pilot","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"---\n## What’s better about the Nissan?\n\n__More safety tech.__ Standard on all Pathfinders is forward collision warning and pre-collision warning and braking. On the Pilot, they’re optional on the mid-grade trims and standard on the higher grades. But it’s worth noting that the Pilot was an IIHS Top Safety Pick for 2018, while the Pathfinder was not. \n\n__Impressive amenities.__ A Bose stereo system. A 360-degree parking camera. A handsfree power tailgate. The Pathfinder offers all of these while the Pilot does not. So if you’re looking for more upmarket goodies, keep this in mind. \n\n__Better towing.__ All-wheel-drive versions of the Pilot can tow up to 5,000 pounds -- not an insignificant amount. But the AWD Pathfinder does this one better with a 6,000-pound rating, an important advantage if you’ve got a large RV, horse trailer or boat to regularly move around. \n\n\n \n---\n\n## What’s better about the Honda?\n\n__Better to drive.__ The gearbox on the Pilot is a six-speed automatic on the LX, EX and EX-L trims and a nine-speed automatic on the Elite and Touring trims. On all Pathfinder models, it’s a CVT type of gearbox. In our testing, we much prefer the traditional automatic setup like that in the Pilot versus a CVT like the one in the Pathfinder. And the Honda has better handling and a more refined driving experience overall. \n\n__Seats up to eight.__ Lower and mid-grade Pilot models with a bench seat in the middle row of seats can seat eight people, with two up front, three in the middle and three in the rear (the higher trims have captain’s chairs in the middle row). Meanwhile, all Pathfinders can only seat two in the rear row of seats. It’s not super roomy back there in either model, but if you’re regularly pulling carpool duty and need three kids in the rear seat, the Pilot is your best bet.\n\n__It’s newer.__ This generation of Pilot went on sale for the 2016 model year while this generation of Pathfinder has been with us since the 2013 model year. This means a variety of the Pilot’s components are more current (safety, drivetrain, refinement). For example, the dashboard and touchscreen infotainment system on the Pilot is much more modern and includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, which the Pathfinder lacks.  \n\n---\n\n## What's the same?\nBoth the Pathfinder and the Pilot have similar powertrains (3.5-liter V6 engines with 280 and 284 horsepower respectively) with optional all-wheel-drive, similar interior dimensions (the Pilot has a smidge more cargo room throughout despite being a shorter vehicle) and similar EPA fuel economy ratings. \n\n \n---\n\n## Autolist’s take:\n The Pathfinder certainly has plenty going for it, including good interior space, stout towing and impressive safety features. But the Pilot wins us over with better driving dynamics, more efficient interior packaging, room for eight and a more modern execution overall. Thus, we say __Buy the Pilot__. \n \n---\n","categories":[{"name":"Comparisons","description":"Comparisons"}],"meta_grade_source_count":13,"publication_date":"2019-02-01T00:00-07:00"},{"slug":"ford-mustang-vs-chevy-camaro","title":"Ford Mustang vs Chevy Camaro","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"---\n\n## What’s better about the Mustang?\n\n__Visibility.__ The Mustang feels like a normal sports coupe from inside; the Camaro feels like you’re peeking out of a box. This may not sound like a big deal but make sure you test drive both models to get a sense of how low the Camaro’s roof feels and how hard it is to see out of it in daily driving.\n\n__Power.__ The base Mustang starts with a 2.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that makes 310 horsepower and 350 pound-feet of torque. The Camaro’s base turbocharged four-cylinder engine makes 275 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque. The optional V8 on the Mustang also has a bit more horsepower (though a bit less torque) than the optional V8 on the Camaro. \n\n__Trunk space.__ No one buys a muscle car like a Camaro or Mustang for its cargo room but it’s a nice bonus to have a useful trunk. Ford’s is considerably larger than Chevy’s; 13.5 cubic feet versus 9.1 cubic feet. \n\n\n---\n\n## What’s better about the Camaro?\n\n__High-performance power.__ For muscle car buyers looking for -- you know, muscle -- the Camaro offers a fire-breathing V8 in a way that the 2018 Mustang doesn’t. The Camaro ZL1 packs a 650-horsepower supercharged V8 while the Mustang Shelby GT350 and 350R have ‘only’ 526 horsepower. \n\n__Better interior.__ The interior of the Camaro is better-designed and aging better than that inside the Mustang. Though the infotainment screen is harder to read on the Camaro, the rest of the cabin feels more upscale and built using better materials than the Mustang -- which feels cheaper than it should. \n\n__More visceral.__ In our own testing, we found the Camaro to be more of a focused driver’s car better suited for enthusiasts looking for a performance-oriented machine. \n\n\n---\n\n## Autolist’s take: \nThis is a tough call and there isn’t a bad choice here. When we at Autolist tested the Camaro SS (V8 version) and the Mustang GT (its V8 version), we walked away thinking the Camaro was the more aggressive and thrilling of the two for more hard-core, enthusiast driving. But if we were choosing one to own and live with on a daily basis, we’d prefer the Mustang. It’s the more comfortable, usable choice that makes fewer compromises.

Both the steering and the handling are more dynamic than most vehicles in this segment, including the Honda CR-V. This is a nice bonus for daily driving.\n\n__Engine choices.__ Ford offers three different engine choices on the Escape: a base non-turbocharged four-cylinder with 168 horsepower and then a pair of turbo four-cylinder choices with 179 and 245 horsepower respectively. This makes it easier for Ford buyers to find the engine that fits their budget and needs. The Honda only offers a 184-horsepower four-cylinder engine on its base CR-V and then a 190-horsepower turbo four cylinder on the rest of the CR-V lineup. \n\n---\n\n## What’s better about the Honda?\n__It’s newer.__ This generation of CR-V was introduced for the 2017 model year while the current Ford Escape first went on sale for the 2013 model year. This means the CR-V will have more modern styling, build materials and safety. \n\n__Speaking of safety:__ The CR-V wins this fight handily. Not only is it rated a Top Safety Pick by the independent Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a designation the agency did not give to the Escape. PLUS most models of the CR-V (not the base) come standard with active safety equipment like adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist, and blind-spot monitoring.\n\n__More space.__ Despite being just two inches longer overall, the CR-V has more cargo space inside and more passenger space...plus more legroom in the rear seats. So this Honda really puts the U in CUV. \n\n__Better reliability.__ Consumer Reports gives the Honda CR-V considerably better reliability scores than it gives the Ford Escape, meaning you’re buying peace of mind (and potentially fewer repairs) if you opt for the Honda over the Ford. \n\n---\n\n## Autolist’s take: \nAs you can see from the Honda’s noticeably longer list of advantages, this is a pretty easy decision. While we appreciate the fact that the Ford is more fun to drive and the engine choices are certainly a nice touch, the Escape’s advantages end there. The CR-V is more modern, useful, safe and reliable and an easy choice for any compact crossover shopper.

The Traverse meanwhile, gets a measly 2/5. That’s a big difference and one you should strongly take into consideration, especially if you plan on owning your next crossover for a long time or if you’re planning on buying a used model. \n\n__More standard safety.__ All trim levels of the 2018 Highlander come standard with active safety features including pre-collision warning and braking with pedestrian detection, lane departure alert with steering assist and adaptive cruise control. To get these features on the Traverse, you have to jump up to nearly the highest trim level (starting at $46,000). \n\n__Hybrid availability.__ Both the Highlander and Traverse offer a V6 engine as standard across most of their trim levels but only the Toyota offers an optional hybrid powertrain for those crossover fans looking to go a little green. It bumps the Highlander’s fuel economy up to 29/27/28 MPG city/highway/combined from the V6’s 20/27/23 MPG rating. \n\n---\n\n## What’s better about the Traverse? \n\n__More space.__ The Traverse beats the Highlander in two key areas of space: total interior volume and third-row space. The insides of the Chevy have 157.3 cubic feet of space, a big advantage over the Toyota’s 144.9 cubic feet. Plus, there’s noticeably more legroom in the Chevy’s third row – a crucial element if you often pull carpool duty. \n\n__It’s newer.__ 2018 marks the first year this generation of Traverse was built while this generation of Highlander is nearly the end of its lifespan. This means the Traverse will offer more modern styling and amenities.\n\n__Better handling.__ Reviewers have praised the Traverse for its good handling while simultaneously criticizing the Highlander for its poor handling. \n\n---\n\n## Autolist’s take: \nThis one depends on what you’re looking for. If cargo space is your primary concern or you’ll regularly be hauling tall kids or adults in the third row of seats, the Traverse might be the better choice here. Plus it’s the newer of the two models here and it’s more fun to drive. But if you can live with a tight third row, we prefer the Toyota overall.

While the Outback does cost more, this is definitely a case of “you get what you pay for.” The Outback also comes with better features and amenities. \n\n__Towing.__ Though neither of these Subaru models has a particularly high towing capacity, the Outback handily beats its Forester sibling. The Outback wagon is rated to tow up to 2,700 pounds, a significant advantage over the Forester’s 1,500-pound capability. Even better about the Outback’s tow rating?

The base model is a 3.5-liter V6 with 290 horsepower while a pair of turbocharged engines are available as options: a 2.3-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder with 280 horsepower and a 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 with a stout 365 horsepower. The Chevy only has a 310-horsepower (non-turbo) 3.6-liter V6 on most models, with a lone sport model offering a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine with 257 horsepower. \n\n__Sync 3.__ This is what Ford calls its proprietary infotainment system that controls nearly everything related to the stereo, navigation system (if equipped), phone connectivity and even many climate controls. Sync 3 is the latest version of this system and Ford has made significant improvements to it – it’s faster, more responsive and more intuitive. \n\n## What’s better about the Chevy?\n\n__More cargo room.__ The Traverse is among the larger crossovers in its three-row segment and this translates into plenty of room for your stuff. This Chevy has 58.1 cubic feet and 23 cubic feet of cargo space with the third row of seats folded/upright respectively while the Ford has 43.9 cubic feet and 21 cubic feet with the third row folded/upright respectively.\n\n__It’s newer.__ 2018 marked the first year Chevy sold this generation of the Traverse. The Ford meanwhile has been around in this same basic form since the 2011 model year, with several big updates along the way (a new generation Explorer is expected for the 2020 model year). This means the Traverse will generally have more modern styling and amenities. \n\n__Better road manners.__ Reviews of the Traverse praise it for its handling and road manners – particularly its refinement. The Ford earns less praise here. \n\n## Autolist’s take: \nFord’s Explorer is one of the original crossovers on the market and the brand’s experience has allowed it to create a compelling vehicle, especially given its age. But it’s the Traverse that’s newer and generally better all around: more room inside, a more modern design throughout the vehicle and better handling. This is an easy one for us: we say __Buy the Traverse.__\n\n---\n","categories":[],"meta_grade_source_count":11,"publication_date":"2018-10-19T00:00-07:00"},{"slug":"2018-honda-cr+v-vs-2018-toyota-rav+4","title":"2018 Honda CR-V vs. 2018 Toyota RAV4","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"---\n\n## What’s better about the Honda CR-V?\n\n__It’s newer.__ Yes, the Toyota and the Honda are both from the 2018 model year, but this generation of CR-V was first introduced in 2017 while the current-generation RAV4 was launched in 2013 (a new generation launches in 2019). So if you’re shopping 2018 models, know that the Honda will have more modern features, safety equipment and comfort levels than the older Toyota.\n\n__Fuel economy.__ The Honda CR-V -- because its powertrain is newer -- gets 27/33/29 MPG city/highway/combined for all-wheel-drive models with the turbo engine. That’s quite a bit better than the 22/28/25 MPG city/highway/combined rating of the AWD RAV4. \n\n__More space.__ The CR-V wins for both cargo volume and passenger volume when compared to the RAV4. Plus, there’s considerably more rear legroom in the Honda than the Toyota.  \n\n---\n\n## What’s better about the Toyota RAV4?\n\n__Hybrid availability.__ The RAV4 is one of the few crossovers in its segment that can be had with an optional all-wheel-drive hybrid powertrain. It boosts fuel economy to an impressive 34/30/32 MPG in city/highway/combined driving. The Honda doesn’t have such an option. \n\n__Bulletproof reliability.__ It’s a Toyota, which means one of the best reputations for reliability in the industry. That’s not to say that Honda is a slouch, but if we’re hedging our reliability bets, it’s with Toyota.\n\n__Active safety tech standard.__ While Honda offers its active safety gear on most models of the CR-V, the RAV4 outdoes these efforts by offering standard on all models features like pre-collision alerts and braking, lane-departure alert and adaptive cruise control. That’s a nice touch. \n\n---\n\n## Autolist’s take: \nThis one just comes down to freshness. The Toyota certainly offers buyers a lot (active safety gear, a hybrid option, reliability plus oodles of practicality common throughout this segment. But the CR-V does all this plus more: it’s quieter, it’s more comfortable, spacious and refined inside and has better fuel economy and features. Plus, there’s no meaningful price difference between the two. For those reasons, we say __Buy the Honda.__\n\n---","categories":[{"name":"Comparisons","description":"Comparisons"}],"meta_grade_source_count":7,"publication_date":"2018-09-14T00:00-07:00"},{"slug":"2016-honda-crv-vs-2017-honda-crv","title":"2016 Honda CR-V vs 2017 Honda CR-V","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"## What’s better about the 2016 CR-V?\n- __It’s cheaper.__ Because it’s the older fourth generation, it will be cheaper on the used market than the 2017 and newer models. So you could spring for a higher-end 2016 CR-V that has more goodies or fewer miles for the same money as a more basic 2017 CR-V. \n- __Plenty useful.__ While there were many upgrades to the CR-V for 2017, the 2016 model still comes with the same overall practicality and general excellent that has made the CR-V so popular. It’s also plenty reliable. \n- __Engine responsiveness.__ Sure the turbo engine on the 2017 CR-V is nice but there are still plenty of advantages to non-turbos, particularly how they accelerate without any of the dreaded “turbo lag.” \n\n## What’s better about the 2017 CR-V?\n- __Turbo!__ This fifth-generation CR-V switches to a more fuel-efficient turbocharged engine on all models except the base LX version...which keeps the 2016 version’s engine. \n- __Better styling.__ This model is arguably much better-looking than its predecessor, both inside and out. Refinement and road manners are improved too (it’s more quiet and responsive).\n- __It’s more modern.__ This means things like a better infotainment system, active safety tech and Apple CarPlay.\n\n## Autolist’s take\nThere’s no bad choice here. Both the 2016 and 2017 CR-V offer the same bulletproof reliability, everyday practicality and reasonable value. While the 2017 model will certainly cost you more, we see it as a worthy upgrade since it promises better styling, a more refined interior and road manners and the new turbocharged engine.

The 2018 Chevy Silverado is the last model year for its generation; the 2019 model is all-new. While this generation of F150 is also getting long in years, it will still be a slightly more modern choice. Plus Ford has done a better job of keeping the F-150 current versus the Chevy. \n\n__Turbo power.__ Ford has wholeheartedly embraced turbocharged engines and it offers two of them on this generation of F150. Both are excellent and offer excellent power, refinement and capabilities. The 2018 F150 also offers an optional (and expensive) diesel engine. This generation of Silverado, meanwhile, doesn’t offer any turbo engines or diesel options. \n\n__Better crash test ratings.__ The Ford F-150 was an IIHS Top Safety Pick for 2017 while the Silverado was not. Key differences in Driver-side front overlap crash results, active safety features and headlights were what separated the two rivals from Ford and Chevy.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## What’s better about the 2018 Silverado?\n\n__Infotainment.__ Ford’s Sync system started off with poor performance when it was launched years ago and while it’s gotten better with subsequent generations, it’s still not as good as Chevy’s. The Silverado’s screen is more responsive, the menus are more intuitive and we even prefer the graphics over those in the Ford. \n\n__V8 options.__ While the Ford has a variety of turbocharged V6 engine available in it (many as pricey options), it only offers a single V8. But some buyers just want a V8. Which is why Chevy’s Silverado may hold an advantage here...it offers two V8s: a 355-horsepower, 5.3-liter unit and a 420-horsepower, 6.2-liter unit. There’s also an additional 5.3-liter V8 with eAssist, a mild hybrid system that uses a small electric motor to add another 13 horsepower, 44 pound-feet of torque and 1 MPG better fuel economy ratings than the regular 5.3-liter unit. \n\n__Cheaper.__ A reasonably well-equipped Silverado with the 5.3-liter V8 is generally cheaper than the comparable Ford F-150 with a turbo V6 that has approximately the same towing and payload capabilities. \n\n---\n\n## Autolist’s take: \nChevy’s Silverado is handsome, refined and easy to drive on a daily basis. But this was the last year of the generation and Ford’s F-150 does all of those things as well as the Chevy and it has other advantages as well. The turbo V6 engines are sublime and the safety features are better, which mean we can say without hesitation __Buy the Ford.__ \n\n","categories":[{"name":"Comparisons","description":"Comparisons"}],"meta_grade_source_count":12,"publication_date":"2019-01-17T00:00-08:00"},{"slug":"gmc-terrain-versus-chevy-equinox","title":"2019 GMC Terrain versus 2019 Chevy Equinox","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"---\n## What’s better about the Terrain?\n__It’s more upscale.__ GMC and Chevy are both owned by General Motors; GMC is the more upscale (and truck/SUV oriented) brand. Thus, the Terrain and Equinox are mechanically similar — it’s the available amenities and style that set the two apart. This means the GMC will have a slightly higher degree of refinement and amenities than the more pedestrian Equinox. Plus, the GMC model offers high-end options that aren’t available on the Chevy, including the Denali trim level that brings an ultimate level of luxury to this compact crossover. \n\n__More modern transmission.__ The GMC comes standard with a nine-speed automatic transmission, an impressive feature for a compact crossover. The Chevy, meanwhile, only has a six-speed auto. This will give the GMC a more modern and refined driving experience since its gearbox is newer (but as we note below, it doesn’t mean the GMC has better fuel economy…the Chevy still wins that battle). \n\n---\n\n## What’s better about the Chevy?\n__It’s cheaper.__ The Equinox starts at about $25,000 for a base L model with the 1.5-liter turbo four and front-wheel-drive. The base GMC Terrain SL (with the same engine and FWD setup) will cost about $1,100 more — even though the vehicles are mechanically identical. The optional Diesel engine — available in both the GMC and Chevy models — spreads that cost difference to around $2,000. Finally, the 2.0-liter turbo four that’s optional on both models can be had for a lot less on the Chevy: $30,895 for the front-wheel-drive LT model, while that engine is only available on the high-end GMC Terrain Denali edition for $40,695. \n\n__More efficient.__ Despite the fact that the GMC has a nine-speed automatic transmission and the Chevy has a six-speed auto, the Chevy manages to get better fuel economy (more speeds usually equates to better MPGs in EPA tests). An AWD Chevy Equinox with the base 1.5-liter turbo four is rated by the EPA at 25/30/27 MPG city/highway/combined, while the GMC Terrain with the same engine gets 24/28/26 MPG. Not a huge loss, but those differences could add up over your ownership of the vehicle. \n\n---\n\n## Autolist’s take?\nThe 2019 GMC Terrain has a lot going for it: a variety of engine choices, a new and refined interior and exterior redesign and a quiet, refined ride. But its close cousin the Chevy Equinox, has all of those features and then adds in better fuel economy and a better value. Since both offer similar handling, ride quality, safety amenities and engine choices, there’s no need to spend the extra money on the GMC, so we say __Buy the Chevy.__\n\n---\n","categories":[],"meta_grade_source_count":12,"publication_date":"2019-03-04T00:00-07:00"},{"slug":"honda-accord-vs-toyota-camry","title":"Honda Accord vs Toyota Camry","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"---\n\n## What’s better about the Accord?\n\n__Space.__ The Accord offers more space where it counts: rear legroom, overall interior space and cargo space in the trunk. These practical advantages add up over the lifespan of the car in a meaningful way.\n\n__Infotainment setup.__ Reviews of both vehicles simultaneously praised the setup in the Accord and dinged the one in the Camry. The Honda’s is lauded for being clear and intuitive while the Toyota’s wasn’t user-friendly and lacked Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. This is a key reason for test drives; to learn which features and elements of the car you’ll be interacting with on a daily basis that will affect how much you like it. \n\n__Refinement__. Both the interior and exterior of the Accord offer a high level of luxury-like refinement, materials and build quality that reviewers have uniformly praised. The Camry, meanwhile, has been criticised for a sub-par interior. \n\n---\n\n## What’s better about the Camry?\n\n__More power.__ Toyota’s Camry comes standard with a 203-horsepower four-cylinder engine and it offers a 301-horsepower V6 as an option. Honda by contrast starts with a 192-horsepower turbocharged, four-cylinder base engine and offers a 252-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder as an option. That’s a nice little bump in power for Camry fans.\n\n__Fuel efficiency.__ The base Camry with the four-cylinder engine is noticeably more efficient than its Honda counterpart. The Toyota is rated by the EPA at 29/41/34 MPG city/highway/combined, compared to the Honda’s rating of 29/35/31 MPG city/highway/combined. The Camry has a longer range too. \n\n__Safety rating.__ The 2018 Camry is rated a Top Safety Pick Plus by the independent Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the organization’s top rating. The Accord -- while still plenty safe -- garners only a Top Safety Pick rating. Both the Accord and Camry earned five-star crash test ratings from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  \n\n---\n\n## Autolist’s take: \nThere’s no bad choice here as these are some of the best-executed sedans on the market. No wonder they each sell hundreds of thousands of Camrys and Accord each year. The Toyota certainly wins on paper in many of the crucial categories: safety ratings, engine power and fuel efficiency. But the Accord is still competitive in each of those categories and then adds a level of refinement, comfort, space and ease-of-use that the Camry can’t match. So if we have to pick a winner here, we say __Buy the Accord.__ \n","categories":[{"name":"Comparisons","description":"Comparisons"}],"meta_grade_source_count":14,"publication_date":"2018-12-21T00:00-08:00"},{"slug":"honda-hrv-vs-subaru-crosstrek","title":"Honda HR-V vs. Subaru Crosstrek","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"---\n\n## What’s better about the HR-V?\n\n__Better, bigger interior.__ Honda’s HR-V is a miracle of interior packaging. Despite measuring seven inches shorter than the Subaru Crosstrek, the Honda offers more interior space, more cargo room and more rear legroom. Plus the rear seatbacks fold down or the seat cushions fold up for more interior capabilities. All in a package that’s easier to park. Talk about win/win.\n\n__Front-wheel-drive availability.__ Sure, AWD sounds like a nice feature to have. But if you live in a warm climate that never sees snow, why pay extra for a feature that will also suck up more gas? Nearly every version of the HR-V offers it in either front-wheel-drive or optional all-wheel-drive. With Crosstrek, every model is AWD-only. \n\n__Cheaper.__ Because you can opt for an HR-V without AWD, buyers on a budget can get into this Honda for less money than they would the Subaru Crosstrek. A base model HR-V with a CVT gearbox is about $21,515 for a 2019 model. The similar Crosstrek with a CVT runs about $23,870. \n\n___\n\n## What’s better about the Crosstrek?\n\n__Better safety ratings.__ The Crosstrek was awarded a Top Safety Pick Plus designation from the IIHS for 2018 and 2019, the agency’s top rating and one few cars received. The HR-V didn’t get such a designation. Plus, base 2018 models of the Crosstrek could be optioned with the EyeSight suite of active safety features that weren’t even available on 2018 HR-Vs (for 2019, Honda made its safety suite -- dubbed Honda Sensing -- standard on EX, EX-L and Touring trims of the HR-V). \n\n__Reliability.__ Consumer Reports gives the Crosstrek a 5 out of 5 for reliability, while the Honda only scored a 2 out of 5. This is one of the key reasons Consumer Reports gave the Crosstrek a coveted ‘Recommended’ rating. \n\n__Better range.__ While both of these models have comparable fuel economy ratings from the EPA, the Subaru has a total range of 481 miles versus the 383-mile range of the Honda. Blame the otherwise excellent interior packaging of the HR-V. This makes road trips more palatable in the Subaru thanks to fewer stops.\n\n___\n\n## Autolist’s take:\nThere’s a lot to like about the Honda HR-V. It has incredible interior packaging, it comes in FWD versions if you live in a warm climate, it’s shorter and easier to park and it will likely cost you less money than a Crosstrek. But we’re smitten by the Subaru’s more rugged and handsome styling, its impressive safety ratings and features and its conspicuously better reliability scores from Consumer Reports. Those attributes are too good to pass up for us, so we say __Buy the Subaru Crosstrek. __\n\n---","categories":[{"name":"Comparisons","description":"Comparisons"}],"meta_grade_source_count":11,"publication_date":"2019-01-31T00:00-07:00"},{"slug":"ford-escape-vs-toyota-rav4","title":"Ford Escape vs Toyota RAV4","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"---\n## What’s better about the Escape?\n\n__Non-hybrid engine choices.__ The RAV4 may have the hybrid available as an option but the Escape has a more non-hybrid engine lineup. Where the Toyota only has one 176-horsepower gas engine, the Ford has three: a base 2.5-liter non-turbo four-cylinder engine with 168 horsepower, a mid-level 1.5-liter turbo four with 179 horsepower and a top-end 2.0-liter turbo four with 245 horsepower. Worth noting: the mid-level Escape’s turbo engine is about as efficient as the RAV4’s only gas engine.\n\n__Better handling.__ Many of the reviews of the 2018 Escape praise it for its handling, which is noticeably more crisp and responsive than the 2018 RAV4. \n\n__Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.__ Toyota’s 2018 RAV4 doesn’t offer this connectivity while the 2018 Ford Escape does. This can be a big deal for people who prioritize connectivity in their next vehicle.\n\n---\n\n## What’s better about the Toyota?\n\n__Safety.__ The independent Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the 2018 RAV4 a Top Safety Pick rating; the Ford Escape didn’t get such a rating. PLUS, the RAV4 comes standard with active safety technologies like adaptive cruise control, pre-collision alert and braking with pedestrian detection and lane-departure warning and steering assist. These features aren’t standard on the 2018 Escape.\n\n__Hybrid.__ While the Ford has more gas engine choices than the RAV4, only this Toyota offers a hybrid engine option. It boosts the non-hybrid’s gas mileage from 22/28/25 MPG city/highway/combined to 34/30/32 MPG city/highway/combined. \n\n__More cargo room.__ The RAV4 boasts 38.4 cubic feet of cargo space while the Escape has 34 cubic feet. Not a huge difference but when you’re buying a vehicle for its utility, things like this are important. \n\n__Reliability.__ Consumer Reports gives a coveted ‘Recommended’ rating to the 2018 RAV4, something it doesn’t give to the Ford Escape. Part of this is because of the RAV4’s superior reliability -- something essential when looking for a new car. \n\n---\n\n## Autolist’s take: \nWe always like a fun-to-drive vehicle, even if it’s a crossover. Not only does the Ford Escape promise that but it also has a wider range of gas engines to choose from and better connectivity inside. But we’re smitten by the Toyota RAV4’s superior reliability, safety, cargo room and the hybrid availability. These are all crucial elements when choosing your next vehicle, so for this reason, we say __Buy the RAV4. __\n\n---\n","categories":[{"name":"Comparisons","description":"Comparisons"}],"meta_grade_source_count":9,"publication_date":"2018-10-19T00:00-07:00"},{"slug":"toyota-sienna-vs-honda-odyssey","title":"Toyota Sienna vs Honda Odyssey ","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"---\n## What’s better about the Sienna?\n\n__All-wheel-drive.__ This is the Sienna’s ace-in-the-hole: it’s the only minivan on the market that offers all-wheel-drive. This is a key asset for families looking to haul people and stuff in winter weather.\n\n__More power.__ The Sienna has 296 horsepower and 263 pound-feet of torque, compared to the Odyssey’s 280 horsepower and 262 pound-feet of torque. While it’s not a huge advantage, the numbers help give the Sienna a nice extra punch in daily driving.\n\n__More reliable.__ Consumer Reports gives the Sienna a higher “Predicted Reliability” score than it gives the Odyssey. It’s not a wide margin – but it’s nice to know the Sienna keeps up Toyota’s longstanding tradition of reliable excellence.\n \n---\n\n## What’s better about the Odyssey?\n\n__Safety \u0026 child seats.__ The independent Insurance Institute for Highway Safety named the 2018 Odyssey a “Top Safety Pick” for 2018; it didn’t give the same rating to the Sienna. The key differentiators were the front overlap crash results and the ease of installing car seats; the Odyssey was superior in both areas.\n\n__It’s newer.__ Honda introduced this generation of Odyssey in 2018 whereas this Toyota Sienna was first on sale in 2010. That means the Honda will generally offer more modern amenities and safety, and better style and comfort levels (though Toyota has done a good job of keeping the Sienna current).\n\n__Amenities.__ An intercom to the back-seat passengers. A vacuum cleaner for the cargo and passenger area. A cabin-facing overhead camera to monitor passengers. Yes, some of these features are optional — but at least they’re offered in the Odyssey.\n\n__More passenger room.__ Though the Sienna technically has more passenger space inside than the Odyssey (164.4 cubic feet in the Toyota versus 160.1 cubic feet in the Honda), the Odyssey makes better use of it: there’s noticeably more legroom and headroom – particularly in the third row. This adds up when you’re regularly packing the van full of people.\n \n---\n\n## Autolist’s take:\nToyota’s Sienna is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a reliable, practical — and crucially — all-wheel-drive family hauler. If AWD is a must-have in your minivan, then the Sienna is your only choice but a good one. But if you can live with front-wheel-drive only — as many families do in cold climates — then the Odyssey is a better choice. It’s newer, quieter, safer and offers a host of (yes, optional) features and space that make it easier to travel with a brood. Thus, we say __Buy the Odyssey.__\n\n---\n","categories":[{"name":"Comparisons","description":"Comparisons"}],"meta_grade_source_count":13,"publication_date":"2019-03-29T00:00-07:00"},{"slug":"ford-fusion-vs-volkswagen-passat","title":"Ford Fusion vs Volkswagen Passat","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"---\n\n## What’s better about the Fusion?\n\n__Better engine lineup.__ The Ford Fusion has a variety of engines to choose from, starting with a base four-cylinder engine with 175 horsepower, two turbo four-cylinder options with 181 and 245 horsepower respectively, a 325-horsepower turbo V6 and a plug-in hybrid. The Passat meanwhile, only has a base 2.0-liter turbo four with 174 horsepower and an optional, 280-horsepower V6. \n\n__Better safety score.__ The independent Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gives the Fusion a Top Safety Pick rating, something it doesn’t give to the Passat. \n\n__All-wheel-drive availability.__ The Fusion offers buyers an optional all-wheel-drive upgrade whereas the Passat is front-wheel-drive across its entire trim line. This could be an important thing to consider if you live in snowy climates and are looking for all-wheel-drive in your family sedan (the Fusion is one of the only models in this segment to offer AWD). \n\n## What’s better about the Passat?\n\n__More upscale feel.__ The VW Passat brings with it German engineering and build quality that lends a more refined air to the Passat, especially with the interior. It feels a notch above the Ford in terms of quality. \n\n__Refined driving habits.__ Not only does the comfort and build quality of the Passat live up to European expectations but the on-road manners of the Passat are equally upscale. This is a comfortable, engaging sedan to drive for long and short trips alike. \n\n__More rear legroom.__ Though they show up on paper has having nearly identical legroom in the rear seats, Ford and VW measure the distance differently. Don't believe the numbers; the Passat's rear seat is cavernous compared to nearly every other sedan in its segment. \n\n## Autolist’s take: \nBoth of these models are aging relative to rivals like the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Hyundai Sonata and Chevy Malibu so be sure to check out those models as well. If you’ve narrowed your list to this VW or this Ford Fusion, both would be a good choice for midsize family sedan fans.

This includes what it can do on the road in awful weather (rain, snow, sleet). This is a boon for shoppers who live in colder climates.\n\n__Engine power \u0026 towing.__ The optional engine on the Cherokee is a 271-horsepower V6 that can tow up to 4,500 pounds. Those are far more impressive than the optional Escape powertrain, which tops out at 245 horsepower and tows 3,500 pounds. \n\n__Interior refinement.__ While many reviewers dinged the insides of the Ford Escape for being too cut-rate and cheap, the quality and comfort of the Cherokee’s interior wins it praise. \n\n\n___\n\n## What’s better about the 2018 Ford Escape?\n\n__Interior space. __ The Escape promises 34 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats (and 68 cubic feet when you fold the rear seats). This easily dwarfs the Cherokee’s 24.6 cubic feet of space behind the rear seats and its 55 cubic feet of space when the seats are folded. But at least the Cherokee promises more legroom in the rear seats. \n\n__Transmission.__ While the Ford only has a six-speed automatic transmission compared to the Jeep’s nine-speed auto, the Ford’s is infinitely better in its execution and smoothness.\n\n__Handling.__ The Ford Escape won a lot of praise from reviewers for its tight and responsive handling. The Jeep? Not so much. It was noted to be dull and uninspiring for daily on-road driving. Might as well have fun while you schlep the kids to soccer practice, right?\n\n\n___\n\n## Autolist’s take:\n The Jeep’s extra refinement and off-road abilities are nice features to have but they’re not enough to offset its smaller cargo space or plodding on-road dynamics. The Ford is what you need it to be: a spacious, practical, fun-to-drive crossover -- even if it gives up a little in the off-road department. With this comparison, we’ll follow the aggregate scoring of the Ford and Jeep reviews and say __Buy the Ford.  __","categories":[],"meta_grade_source_count":9,"publication_date":"2018-09-07T00:00-07:00"},{"slug":"2015-ram-1500-pickup-vs-2015-ford-f-150","title":"2015 Ram 1500 Pickup vs. 2015 Ford F-150","author":{"name":"David Undercoffler","title":"Editor in Chief","email":"david@autolist.com"},"content":"### Similarities\n- Both trucks offer a range-topping V8 engine and a base V6 gas engine. \n- Reviews of both the Ram and the Ford praised the trucks for their on-road handling and refinement. \n- Both trucks can be optioned up with high-end features like heated and cooled leather seats, navigation systems and high-end stereos.\n\n### Differences\n- The key difference between these two trucks is the 2015 Ford F150 has a body that’s made from aluminum rather than steel, like the Ram 1500 and nearly every other car/truck/vehicle that’s on the road today. Aluminum saves weight and (marginally) boosts fuel economy but it can also mean higher bills when it comes to repairs.\n- The Ford F150 is available with two different turbocharged V6 engines (both optional), something the Ram 1500 doesn’t offer at all. \n- However, the Ram offers a diesel engine option while the 2015 F150 does not. \n\n\n## Autolist’s take\nAs the scores suggest, this is a close one. The Ford F150 packs optional and highly-regarded turbocharged V6 engines, an aluminum body and a wide variety of beds, engines and price points. Meanwhile, the Ram offers key options like air suspension, the diesel engine and exterior storage compartments. While the Ford may cost more when it comes to body repair, many reviewers were quick to point out reliability issues over time with Ram’s parent company FCA. So to us, that’s the deciding factor.

VW has long been known for sprinkling a refreshing dose of European refinement into its mainstream vehicles and this Jetta is no different. You’ll find the Jetta’s build quality and interior noise levels to be a touch more upscale than the Civic’s.\n\n__Space.__ Technically the Jetta is in a different segment than the Civic because it has more interior space. This is a win for buyers who will appreciate the extra headroom and legroom throughout the Jetta’s interior.\n \n---\n \n## What’s better about the Civic?\n\n__Reliability.__ Consumer Reports gave the 2018 Civic a 3/5 for reliability while the organization gave the 2018 Jetta a 2/5. That gives you extra peace of mind if you choose the Honda.\n\n__Body styles.__ Coupe? Hatchback? Sedan? No matter what shape you’d like your compact car to come in, Honda has you covered. It’s one of the few automakers in this segment to offer all three variants, each with its own strengths (utility for the hatch, style and sportiness for the coupe, everyday practicality for the sedan). The Jetta is sedan-only.\n\n__It’s newer.__ This generation of Civic was introduced in 2016 while this generation of Jetta was introduced in 2011. That means the Civic will be a more modern vehicle, with better amenities and safety features.\n\n__Efficient.__ The Civic with the 1.5-liter turbocharged engine that’s on most models is rated by the EPA at 32/42/36 MPG city/highway/combined. That’s quite a bit higher than the most common Jetta powertrain (1.8-liter turbo), which the EPA rates at 24/33/28.\n\n---\n \n## Autolist’s take: \nThe 2018 Jetta is a perfectly capable and refined model and its added space over the Civic would be appreciated by anyone. But it’s aging; an entirely new generation went on sale for the 2019 model year with substantial updates. Meanwhile the 2018 Civic is relatively new and it has everything you’re looking for in a compact car: efficiency, safety and reliability.

But the automaker doesn’t update its trucks as often as other brands, so it lags behind many of its competitors in a variety of areas. Ram trucks can be less reliable than Toyotas over the years but Rams offer a wide range of advantages including interior comfort and refinement, fuel economy, practicality and ride quality.

The Toyota comes with one of two V8 engines. \n\n__Aluminum body.__ Ford’s 2015 F150 has a body made largely from aluminum, rather than steel like nearly all other vehicles on the market. This makes the Ford lighter (thus more fuel efficient) but also more expensive to repair at the body shop. \n\n__Overall refinement.__ Ford’s truck promises higher levels of options and refinement than Toyota’s, which is relatively utilitarian. \n\n\n___\n\n## What’s better about the 2015 Toyota Tundra?\n\n__Reliability.__ It’s hard to argue with Toyota’s track record of reliability, especially with its long history of trucks and SUVs. That brings you peace of mind when buying used. \n\n__Sliding rear window.__ We know this is a minor advantage but it’s one we’ve always liked: this generation of Tundra has a rear window that slides vertically into the panel below it. Every other truck on the market (including the Ford) uses a conventional, horizontally-sliding window panel that is much smaller and not nearly as cool as Toyota’s.\n\n__Fixes will cost less.__ As we mentioned, the Tundra has a steel body, which any body shop can repair cheaply and easily. The Ford will not only cost more to repair thanks to its aluminum body (and not all body shops have the right equipment), but it will also cost more to insure. \n\n\n___\n\n## Autolist’s take:\nThis is one of those comparisons where there are no bad choices. The Toyota is more simple, likely cheaper on the used market (and cheaper to fix and insure) and packs a lot of interior space and comfort and a big brawny V8. But the Ford has more choices all around (engines, interior options and beds) so you’re more likely to find the perfect model to fit your budget and your needs. __We say Buy the Ford. __","categories":[{"name":"Comparisons","description":"Comparisons"}],"meta_grade_source_count":8,"publication_date":"2018-09-07T00:00-07:00"},{"slug":"mazda-cx5-vs-honda-crv","title":"Mazda CX-5 versus Honda CR-V","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"---\n\n## What’s better about the CX-5?\n\n__Handling.__ Many people don’t prioritize how their crossover drives — which makes sense considering you buy them for other reasons. But this Mazda does many things well and then on top of that, includes sharp handling as a bonus — like all other Mazda models do. \n\n__Sharp styling.__ In addition to the class-leading handling, the CX-5 has another ace up its sleeve — how it looks. Mazda’s entire lineup is one of the sleekest non-luxury brands in the industry and the CX-5 continues that trend with aplomb. It’s far more refined than anything else in its segment, including the Honda. Inside and out, the CX-5 looks like it should be wearing a German luxury brand label while paying mainstream prices. We won’t tell if you don’t.\n\n__Automatic transmission.__ While nearly all of its peers also offer a CVT style of automatic gearbox, the Mazda continues to use a traditional six-speed automatic. While CVTs do have a reputation for being less thirsty at the gas pump, they’re also less enjoyable than a conventional automatic. So while the fuel economy on the CX-5 suffers some, it makes up for it in driving enjoyment. \n\n---\n\n## What’s better about the CR-V?\n\n__All-aroundedness.__ Yes, it’s a word. The best word to describe the CR-V. No other mainstream (non-luxury) compact crossover does so many things so well as the CR-V. The Toyota RAV4 comes close but the CR-V is top of the segment in our book. Nothing against the Mazda CX-5, but if you’re looking for one vehicle that can do it all, it’s the Honda. \n\n__More interior space.__ You’re buying a CUV for its practicality right? So pay attention to the CR-V’s superior cargo space (39.2 cubic feet compared to the Mazda’s 30.9 cubic feet) and its additional legroom in both the front and rear seats. \n\n__More fuel efficient.__ Both versions of the Honda CR-V (base non-turbo and the remaining lineup of turbo models) beat both versions of the CX-5 (non-turbo and turbo) for fuel efficiency by fairly respectable numbers. That’s just money in your pocket. \n\n\n___\n\n## Autolist’s take:\nThis is a tough call since we’re huge fans of both models. On paper, the CR-V is the most well-rounded model in its segment, followed closely by the Toyota RAV4. As we mentioned, Honda just does everything well; it’s safe, functional, comfortable and efficient. Meanwhile, the Mazda sacrifices some fuel efficiency and interior space but definitely has the edge when it comes to styling, refinement and driving dynamics. Ultimately, that’s a tradeoff we’re willing to make, so we say __Buy the Mazda.__ ","categories":[{"name":"Comparisons","description":"Comparisons"}],"meta_grade_source_count":12,"publication_date":"2019-03-04T00:00-07:00"},{"slug":"2018-ford-edge-versus-2018-ford-escape","title":"2018 Ford Edge vs. 2018 Ford Escape","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"\n## What’s better about the 2018 Ford Edge?\n\n__More of everything. __Not only is the Edge larger than the Escape (for both passengers and cargo), but it’s positioned higher up in Ford’s CUV lineup so it has more engine power and more standard features. \n\n__Refinement. __Because the Edge is higher up Ford’s food chain than the Escape, it’s also a more refined experience inside (quieter, more comfortable) compared to the more utilitarian Escape. \n\n__Engines.__ The Edge also offers more engine choices: a 245-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder is the base engine, while a 315-horsepower turbocharged V6 or a 280-horsepower V6 is available. \n\n\n___\n\n## What’s better about the 2018 Ford Escape?\n\n__It’s cheaper.__ For 2018, the Escape starts at $24,935 while the higher-end Edge starts at $30,310. This means you can either pocket the extra cash or add many more options to the Escape -- something most reviews recommend since they found the base Escape to be too spartan. Or do both. \n\n__Maneuverability.__ The Escape measures about ten inches shorter than the Edge, making it easier to park and turn in tight situations. Reviewers also praised the Edge for its sharp handling. These factors could make the Escape easier to live with on a daily basis. \n\n__It matches the Edge’s towing.__ Though the Escape is a smaller, lighter and cheaper vehicle, it can still go toe-to-toe with the Edge when it comes to towing capacity: 3,500 pounds. That’s an impressive number for the smaller Escape and it’s higher than nearly all of the Escape’s competitors. \n\n\n___\n\n## Autolist’s take:\nIt’s worth noting that both the 2018 Escape and the 2018 Edge are nearing the end of their lifespans (indeed, the Edge is all-new for 2019) so both models are relatively outdated when compared with rivals from other brands. That being said, the 2018 versions of each of these Fords has aged well. While you’ll likely find more refinement and space with the Edge, the Escape can still offer plenty of useful space in a fun-to-drive, easy-to-live-with package that leads its segment in towing.

It’s smaller on the outside but not much smaller on the inside, and while it has 20 fewer horsepower, the X1 also weighs 500 pounds less, so it has a better power-to-weight ratio. This is a long way of saying that with the X1, you get almost the same capabilities as the X3, but in a more compelling package. \n\n__Better parking/maneuverability.__ The X1 is about a foot shorter overall than the X3 and about 500 pounds lighter, so it’s easier to park and maneuver than the larger X3. This is a big advantage for owners living in more urban areas where agility and parking spaces matter. \n\n__It’s cheaper.__ Since the X1 is BMW’s entry-level crossover while the X3 is its midrange model, the X1 is cheaper. 2018 models started at about $36,000 for the X1 and $42,000 for the X3. \n\n\n___\n\n## What’s better about the X3?\n\n__It’s bigger.__ This is an obvious one, but the X3 has five extra cubic feet of cargo space and several extra inches of rear legroom and headroom and front legroom and headroom. So if space matters for you, your passengers and your cargo (including child seats, which are a tight fit in the X1), consider the X3.\n\n__More luxurious.__ Because the X3 is higher in BMW’s lineup of crossovers than the X1, it’s a more luxurious vehicle. This means it offers features that the X1 doesn’t, like 10-way power front seats (the X1’s are eight-way), wood trim, a 12-speaker stereo (it’s seven speakers on the X1), three-zone climate control and a larger touchscreen infotainment system. You can also add a variety of high-end options to the X3 that aren’t available on the X1 (including a 355-horsepower, six-cylinder engine) and the X3’s base engine has 248 horsepower to the X1’s 228 horsepower. \n\n__Better safety rating.__ The 2018 X3 received a Top Safety Pick Plus designation from the independent IIHS, the agency’s highest rating. The X1, meanwhile, didn’t garner any notable safety rating from the IIHS. \n\n\n___\n\n## Autolist’s take:\nThe X3 is a great vehicle and its strong suits include excellent handling, safety, amenities and interior fit and finish. But if you can give up some of the (pricey) options on the X3 and a little of its interior space, you’ll get a lot of vehicle in the X1. Better packaging, parking/maneuverability, exterior styling and power-to-weight ratio make the X1 a more compelling choice, and it’s thousands of dollars cheaper too.

These include a back-seat camera to monitor your passengers, an in-car PA system so even kids with headphones won’t be tuned out from mom and dad and a built-in shop vac in the rear cargo area to clean up those pesky messes. \n\n__Better driving.__ Though subjective, we enjoyed driving the Odyssey more than we did the Pacifica. The Honda feels like it has a bit more pep in its step (though the two models have virtually the same amount of horsepower and torque) and its handling is a little tighter and more responsive. \n\n__Middle-row seats.__ Ok, so they don’t magically fold into the floor like the Pacifica’s, but the middle seats in the Odyssey do have some tricks of their own. Namely, they can slide fore and aft (to bring a child seat closer to the front passenger seat, for example) and they slide from side to side as well, giving you plenty of options for seating configurations. \n\n \n---\n\n## What’s better about the Chrysler?\n\n__Stow ‘n Go seats.__ For more than a decade now, Chrysler and Dodge minivans have offered this ingenious feature that no other brand can match. They’re essentially individual middle-row seats that flip and fold in the floor beneath them when you need more interior space. Other minivans have removable seats but they’re very heavy and awkward and you need a place to keep them. \n\n__It’s cheaper.__ The Pacifica starts at $28,390 (including destination) whereas the Odyssey starts $2,795 higher at $31,185. Granted, the base Pacifica is pretty sparse in terms of amenities (no Stow ‘n Go seats for example) but if you’re shopping purely on a budget, the Chrysler is the way to go. \n\n__Available plug-in hybrid.__ Chrysler is currently the only minivan that offers a hybrid alternative...and it’s a plug-in model at that. The Pacifica Hybrid is pricey -- starting at $41,490 -- but it would also be eligible for various state and federal incentives that could drop the price significantly (California residents could get a $7,500 federal credit and up to $1,500 in state rebates, dropping the price to a very reasonable $32,490). You just have to give up the Stow ‘n Go seats too. \n\n \n---\n\n## Autolist’s take:\nWe’re big fans of Honda and the Odyssey in particular. It’s a practical, safe and comfortable family hauler that we have no problem recommending. But the Pacifica is that and more: better features (the Stow ‘n Go is a huge plus) and better styling plus the optional Hybrid model. So if we’re forced to choose, we say __Buy the Chrysler. __\n\n---\n","categories":[],"meta_grade_source_count":13,"publication_date":"2019-02-01T00:00-07:00"},{"slug":"toyota-tacoma-vs-toyota-tundra","title":"Toyota Tacoma vs. Toyota Tundra","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"---\n\n## What’s better about the Tacoma?\n\n__It’s cheaper.__ The Tacoma is the smaller of the two, so naturally it’s cheaper. This midsize model starts at $26,595, compared to the Tundra’s starting price of $32,815 (both prices include destination). If you’re on a budget but have your heart set on a Toyota truck, the Tacoma is your best bet.\n\n__It’s newer.__ Toyota hasn’t given the Tundra a thorough makeover since 2007; the Tacoma, on the other hand, was redesigned for the 2016 model year. This means the Tacoma will be more modern in its amenities and build quality (though Toyota has done a decent job of keeping the Tundra fresh). \n\n__Better resale value.__ The Tacoma has long been considered the leader of the midsize truck pack, with bulletproof reliability and class-leading capabilities. So its resale value is excellent, no matter how old. The Tundra, on the other hand, is generally thought of as an also-ran compared to the full-size trucks from Ford, Chevy and Ram, which dominate the sales charts. So it commands less on the used market. \n\n\n---\n\n## What’s better about the Tundra?\n\n__More capabilities.__ As you might expect given that the Tundra is a full-size V8 truck versus the Tacoma’s midsize designation, the Tundra can do more. Its payload is higher (1,730 vs 1,540 max) and its tow rating is higher (10,200 lbs vs the Tacoma’s 6,800 lbs max).\n\n__Space.__ This is an obvious one. The Tundra offers huge amounts of interior space and bed space, whereas the interior of the Tacoma can feel cramped and the bed size is smaller (but average for a midsize truck). This lends an upscale feel to the experience of driving the bigger, higher Tundra. \n\n__Bigger engines.__ The Tundra offers a choice of V8 engines: a base, 4.6-liter unit that makes 310 horsepower or an optional 5.7-liter engine that makes 381 horsepower. Most models of the Tacoma have a 3.5-liter V6 that makes 278 horsepower; the base model uses a 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine with 159 horsepower.\n\n\n---\n\n## Autolist’s take: \nThis is a tough one because it all depends on what you need out of a truck. The Tundra is big, capable and comfy. But it’s getting old relative to both the smaller Tacoma and its fellow full-size rivals (Ford F-150, Ram 1500 and Chevy Silverado), all of which are newer and significantly more competitive. The Tacoma on the other hand, remains at the top of the midsize truck class, and while it can’t do the things the Tundra can, it’s also smaller, cheaper, more fuel efficient and consistently in higher demand than the Tundra is. So for this reason, if it’s between these two models, we say __Buy the Tacoma.__ \n\n","categories":[{"name":"Comparisons","description":"Comparisons"}],"meta_grade_source_count":9,"publication_date":"2019-01-17T00:00-08:00"},{"slug":"audi-a3-vs-audi-a4","title":"Audi A3 vs. Audi A4","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"---\n\n## What’s better about the A3?\n\n__More engine choices.__ The Audi A3 offers a wide variety of powertrain choices: there are two horsepower ratings for its 2.0-liter turbo engine (185 horsepower or 220 horsepower), the 292-horsepower S3, the 400 horsepower RS3 and the 204-horsepower A3 etron plug-in hybrid hatchback. The A4, meanwhile, doesn’t offer an RS model or a plug-in hybrid model. \n\n__Interior space.__ While the A3 is smaller and less expensive than the A4, it offers nearly comparable interior space. Both headroom and legroom for the front and rear seats is nearly identical (though neither is particularly spacious), and the A3’s cargo space in the trunk is just a smidge less than the A4’s (when comparing front-wheel-drive models). The only meaningful measurement where the A3 can’t keep up with the A4 is interior width, an issue only if you plan on packing three adults in the back seat. \n\n__It’s cheaper.__ Audi’s A3 is the cheapest model the automaker sells in the U.S. and in 2018, it started at around $33,500, including destination. That’s about $5,000 cheaper than the base price of a 2018 Audi A4. And A3 buyers get a lot for their money, including a panoramic moonroof, leather seats that are heated up front, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity and low-speed pre-collision braking.\n\n\n\n___\n\n## What’s better about the A4?\n\n__It’s newer.__ This generation of Audi A4 first went on sale in the U.S. for the 2017 model year, while this generation of A3 has been with us since 2014. This means the A4 will offer more modern construction and amenities than its smaller sibling, though both models have equally strong safety ratings. \n\n__More options.__ Because the A4 is positioned higher in Audi’s sedan lineup, it comes with a more luxurious and higher-class interior and it’s offered with a wider range of goodies -- if you’re willing to pay for them. Options include a heads-up display, Sport leather seats, a 360-degree camera system, touchpad for the infotainment system, heated rear seats, adaptive cruise control with traffic jam assist and a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. \n\n__Fuel efficiency.__ The Audi A3 and A4 -- when equipped with the same 2.0-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder engine -- get the same fuel economy ratings from the EPA. This, despite the fact that the A3 is a smaller sedan than the A4. \n\n\n\n___\n\n## Autolist’s take:\nThe A4 is a very nice sedan that offers an impressive amount of refinement and comfort for its ultra-competitive class. But we like the A3, despite its age. This smaller sedan still offers useful interior space, a more engaging driving style and easier daily living thanks to tighter parking abilities. Plus, it can be optioned up with nearly every amenity that the A4 offers, so you’re not missing out on the good stuff. So this is why we say __Buy the A3.__ \n\n---","categories":[{"name":"Comparisons","description":"Comparisons"}],"meta_grade_source_count":9,"publication_date":"2019-04-03T12:37-07:00"},{"slug":"toyota-camry-vs-ford-fusion","title":"Toyota Camry vs Ford Fusion","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"---\n\n## What’s better about the 2018 Camry?\n__More standard power.__ The base Camry now comes with 203 horsepower and 184 pound-feet of torque. That’s better than the two base engines on the Fusion; they have 175 horsepower/175 pound-feet of torque and 181 horsepower/185 pound-feet of torque respectively.  \n\n__Better hybrid.__ Toyota is a pioneer in the hybrid world of autos so it’s no surprise that its Camry Hybrid is significantly more fuel efficient than the Fusion Hybrid. The 2018 Camry Hybrid is rated by the EPA at 51/53/52 MPG city/highway/combined. Meanwhile, the Ford is rated at 43/41/42 MPG city/highway/combined.\n\n__Better standard safety features.__ All trim levels of this 2018 Camry come standard with an impressive grab-bag of active safety features. These include pre-collision warning and braking with pedestrian detection, lane-departure alert with steering assist and adaptive cruise control. On the Ford, these features are optional.\n\n---\n \n## What’s better about the 2018 Ford?\n\n__More space.__ The Fusion has a bit more passenger space and cargo space than the Camry. The numbers aren’t overwhelmingly in Ford’s favor but they’re enough to take note of if size is a crucial factor in choosing your midsize sedan.\n\n__All-wheel-drive.__ For buyers who want the peace of mind that all-wheel-drive can bring, Ford’s Fusion has it as an option while Toyota’s Camry doesn’t.\n\n__More performance options.__ Buyers looking to mix a little fun into their family sedans have better ways to do it with the Fusion since it offers a more robust performance-oriented engine option with its 2.7-liter turbocharged V6 engine. It makes 325 horsepower compared to the Camry’s optional (non-turbo) V6 that makes 301 horsepower.  \n\n__Plug-in hybrid availability.__ For all Toyota’s expertise in hybrids, they lack one thing the Ford Fusion offers: a plug-in hybrid model. It is rated at 97 MPGe by the EPA and comes with 21 miles of electric-only range before switching to gas.\n\n---\n \n## Autolist’s take: \nThis generation of Ford’s Fusion has been one of the better-looking models in the family sedan segment since it first came out as a 2013 model. It also packs a nice variety of engine choices, great interior and trunk space and the option for all-wheel-drive. But the 2018 Camry counters all that will impeccable reliability, more standard power (matched with handling that got much better for 2018) and important safety features standard. These benefits are too good to ignore, so we say __Buy the Camry.__\n\n---\n\n","categories":[{"name":"Comparisons","description":"Comparisons"}],"meta_grade_source_count":13,"publication_date":"2018-10-19T00:00-07:00"},{"slug":"2018-jeep-cherokee-versus-2018-subaru-forester","title":"2018 Jeep Cherokee vs. 2018 Subaru Forester","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"## What’s better about the Jeep?\n__Power.__ The 2018 Jeep Cherokee can be had with one of two different engines: a naturally-aspirated four-cylinder with 184 or 271-horsepower V6. Both have more power than the respective Forester engines (the base non-turbo version in the Subaru has 170 horsepower and the optional turbo-four has 250 horsepower). \n\n__Refinement.__ The Jeep Cherokee is noticeably more quiet and comfortable than the decidedly utilitarian Forester. The Jeep doors close with a more satisfying “thunk,” road and wind noise is banished from the cabin and the entire Cherokee just feels more solid than its Subaru counterpart. \n\n__Space for humans.__ Inside the Cherokee is a few more inches of legroom and headroom in all seats, front and rear, than what you’ll find in the Subaru. It’s not an overwhelming difference but as tall passengers will tell you, every inch counts. \n\n---\n\n## What’s better about the Subaru?\n\n__Space for stuff.__ Though they’re only about an inch apart in length, the Subaru has heaps of cargo space when compared to the Cherokee: 10 additional cubic feet when the rear seats are up and 20 additional cubic feet of cargo space when the rear seats are folded. So while the Jeep has marginally more passanger room, the Subaru has a big advantage with cargo room. \n\n__Recalls \u0026 reliability.__ Here, Subaru’s reputation shines through. Not only is the brand and the Forester itself highly rated for reliability (including by Consumer Reports) but the 2018 model doesn’t have any recalls associated with it. The same can’t be said for the 2018 Jeep Cherokee, which has four recalls associated with it and a lower reliability rating.\n\n__Fuel economy.__ The Subaru has a noticeably better fuel economy rating from the EPA than the Cherokee.  The base Forester with the non-turbo engine and the automatic transmission is rated at 26/32/28 MPG city/highway/combined. The Jeep with the base engine and nine-speed automatic transmission is rated at 21/28/23 MPG city/highway/combined. \n\n---\n\n## Autolist's take: \nReviewers found the Jeep to have better refinement, off-road capabilities and more room for its passengers than the Forester. But the Subaru fights back with better reliability, fuel economy and cargo space. In this comparison, we’re willing to sacrifice a little comfort for long-term peace-of-mind. So we say __Buy the Subaru.__ ","categories":[],"meta_grade_source_count":8,"publication_date":"2018-09-07T00:00-07:00"},{"slug":"honda-pilot-vs-ford-explorer","title":"Honda Pilot vs. Ford Explorer","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"---\n## What’s better about the Honda Pilot?\n\n__Seats up to eight.__ Lower and mid-grade Pilot models with a bench seat in the middle row of seats can seat eight people, with two up front, three in the middle and three in the rear (the higher trims have captain’s chairs in the middle row). Meanwhile, all Explorers can only seat two in the rear row of seats. It’s not super roomy back there in either model, but if you’re regularly pulling carpool duty and need three kids in the rear seat, the Pilot is your best bet.\n\n__It’s newer.__ This generation of Pilot went on sale for the 2016 model year while this generation of Explorer first debuted for the 2011 model year (though Ford updated it in 2016 and 2018); an all-new Explorer will launch for the 2020 model year. So when comparing the ‘18 Pilot to the ‘18 Explorer, remember that the Pilot will have more modern safety tech, build construction (to save weight and fuel) and interior packaging and refinement. \n\n__Interior packaging:__ Despite measuring several inches shorter than the Explorer, Honda’s Pilot offers more headroom and marginally more legroom in the second and third row of seats...plus more cargo room too. People buy these crossovers to be practical...so this is an important advantage for the Pilot. \n\n__Safety.__ Not only does the Pilot have better crash safety ratings from the IIHS but the Honda also offers features like adaptive cruise control and pre-collision braking on a wider (and cheaper) spectrum of the Pilot than Ford does on the Explorer. Short version: you have to spend thousands more on a relatively high-end Explorer to get the same active safety tech as a mid-grade Pilot. \n \n---\n\n## What’s better about the Ford Explorer?\n\n__Engine choices.__ The 2018 Explorer comes with one of three engine choices. Base models start with a 290-horsepower V6 and a 280-horsepower turbo four or a 365-horsepower turbocharged V6 are optional. The Pilot, meanwhile, only offers a 280-horsepower V6. So if you’re picky about your engine (or engine’s power), the Ford has more to offer you. \n\n__Amenities.__ Ford’s Explorer offers things like a hands-free power tailgate, WiFi connectivity, massaging front seats and a self-parallel park system. While they’re all optional, they can be nice features to have...and they’re nice features that the ‘18 Pilot doesn’t offer.\n\n \n---\n\n## Autolist’s take:\nFord’s Explorer has long been one of the most popular crossovers on the market and this model shows why: it has excellent styling, a nice range of engine choices and amenities that will make any owner’s life more enjoyable. But all this can’t mask its age, or the fact that Pilot does the important things better: more safety and interior refinement, better handling and interior packaging and seating for eight. So this is an easy one for us: we say __Buy the Pilot.__ \n \n---\n","categories":[{"name":"Comparisons","description":"Comparisons"}],"meta_grade_source_count":13,"publication_date":"2019-02-01T00:00-07:00"},{"slug":"volkswagen-jetta-vs-toyota-corolla","title":"Volkswagen Jetta vs Toyota Corolla","author":{"name":"Autolist Staff","title":"Staff","email":"press@autolist.com"},"content":"## What’s better about the Jetta?\n__More power.__  The Jetta comes standard with a 1.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that makes 150 horsepower, compared to the 132-horsepower on the standard 1.8-liter (non-turbo) engine inside the Corolla. The Jetta also offers an optional 1.8-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that makes 170 horsepower. \n\n__Better handling.__ The Jetta -- by way of its German heritage -- generally handles better than the Corolla, according to a consensus of automotive reviewers. Neither of the two is a sportscar, but the Jetta lets you have some everyday fun. \n\n__More cargo room.__ It’s not a huge advantage but it helps: the Jetta has about 20 percent more space in the trunk than the Corolla does. \n\n---\n\n## What’s better about the Corolla?\n\n__It’s more reliable.__ Consumer Reports gives the 2018 Corolla a much higher reliability rating than its Volkswagen Jetta counterpart (5/5 for the Corolla versus ⅖ for the Jetta). This goes a long way toward peace of mind during ownership.\n\n__Safety.__ The 2018 Corolla comes standard with active safety features like pre-collision braking and alerts with pedestrian detection, lane-departure alert and steering assist and adaptive cruise control. AND it’s rated a Top Safety Pick by the independent Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The Jetta doesn’t have such a rating from the IIHS nor does it come standard with this safety gear. \n\n__More passenger space.__ If you’ll be using the rear seats regularly, consider that the Corolla has several inches additional legroom versus the Jetta. \n\n---\n\n## Autolist’s take: \nThe Jetta’s German engineering is a nice touch in a price-conscious segment like this. And the Jetta’s more powerful engines, better handling and extra cargo space are all appreciated. But we’re swayed by the reliability, safety and passenger space of the Corolla; all three are hugely important in a vehicle of any size. So we say __Buy the Corolla.__ \n\n","categories":[],"meta_grade_source_count":8,"publication_date":"2018-10-19T00:00-07:00"}],"contentGroups":{"default":"ContentUrl"},"host":"https://www.autolist.com","path":"/guides"},"query":{}},"page":"/guides","query":{},"buildId":"ZwtKa2hYBnEz80ifbX7Yn","dynamicBuildId":false,"assetPrefix":"https://web-assets-production.autolist.com"}</script><script async="" id="__NEXT_PAGE__/guides" src="https://web-assets-production.autolist.com/_next/static/ZwtKa2hYBnEz80ifbX7Yn/pages/guides.js"></script><script async="" id="__NEXT_PAGE__/_app" src="https://web-assets-production.autolist.com/_next/static/ZwtKa2hYBnEz80ifbX7Yn/pages/_app.js"></script><script src="https://web-assets-production.autolist.com/_next/static/runtime/webpack-fb2871b9b99961719225.js" async=""></script><script src="https://web-assets-production.autolist.com/_next/static/chunks/commons.b345c1be98f8dbd973a3.js" async=""></script><script src="https://web-assets-production.autolist.com/_next/static/runtime/main-df013fc469cb273c6215.js" async=""></script><script src="https://web-assets-production.autolist.com/_next/static/chunks/styles.86fac7c9eae3bef05de1.js" async=""></script></body></html>
